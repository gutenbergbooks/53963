<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Introductory. The Sepulchres of Etruria.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Grotta del Tifoné”—an Etruscan tomb
opened by the Chevalier Manzi, in 1833—discovered
some peculiarities at the time of its opening, which
greatly mystified the cognoscenti of Italy. It was
found, by certain Roman inscriptions upon two of
the sarcophagi, that the inmates belonged to another
people, and that the vaults of the noble Tarquinian
family of Pomponius, had, for some unaccountable
reasons, been opened for the admission of the stranger.
No place was so sacred among the Etruscans as that
of burial; and the tombs of the Lucumones of Tarquinia,
were held particularly sacred to the immediate
connections of the chief. Here he lay in state,
and the scions and shoots of his blood and bosom
were grouped around him, being literally, as the old
Hebrew phraseology hath it, “gathered to their
fathers.” It was not often, and then only under
peculiar circumstances, which rendered the exception
to the rule proper, that the leaves of stone which
closed the mausoleum were rolled aside for the admission
of foreigners. The “Grotta del Tifoné,” so
called from the Etruscan Typhon, or Angel of Death,
which appears conspicuously painted upon the
square central pillar, was the last resting-place of the
distinguished family of Pomponius. It is a chamber
eighteen paces long, and sixteen broad, and is hewn
out in the solid rock. The sarcophagi were numerous
when first discovered. The ledges were
full—every place was occupied, and a further excavation
had been made for the reception of other
tenants. These tombs were all carefully examined
by the explorers with that intense feeling of curiosity
which such a discovery was calculated to inspire.
The apartment was in good preservation; the paintings
bright and distinct, though fully twenty-two
centuries must have elapsed since the colors were
first spread by the hands of the artist. And there
were the inscriptions, just declaring enough to
heighten and to deepen curiosity. A name, a fragment—and
that in Latin. That a Roman should
sleep in a tomb of the Etruscan, was itself a matter
of some surprise; but that this strangeness should
be still further distinguished by an inscription, an
epitaph, in the language of the detested nation—as if
the affront were to be rendered more offensive and
more imposing—was calculated still further to provoke
astonishment! Why should the hateful and
always hostile Roman find repose among the patriarchs
of Tarquinia?—the rude, obscure barbarian,
in the mausoleum of a refined and ancient family?
Why, upon an Etruscan tomb, should there be other
than an Etruscan inscription? One of the strangers
was a woman! Who was she, and for what was
she thus distinguished? By what fatality came she
to find repose among the awful manes of a people,
between whom and her own, the hatred was so
deep and inextinguishable—ending not even with the
entire overthrow of the superior race? The sarcophagus
of the other stranger was without an inscription.
But he, too, was a Roman! His effigy, betraying
all the characteristics of his people, lay at length
above his tomb; a noble youth, with features of exquisite
delicacy and beauty, yet distinguished by that
falcon visage, which so well marked the imposing
features of the great masters of the ancient world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wonder and delight of our visiters were hardly
lessened, while their curiosity was stimulated to a
still higher degree of intensity, as their researches
led them to another discovery which followed the
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>
further examination of the “Grotta.” On the right
of the entrance they happened upon one of these exquisite
paintings, in which the genius of the Etruscan
proves itself to have anticipated, though it may never
have rivaled the ultimate excellence of the Greek.
The piece describes a frequent subject of art—a procession
of souls to judgment, under the charge of
good and evil genii. The group is numerous. The
grace, freedom, and expression of the several figures
is beyond description fine; and, with two exceptions,
the effect is exquisitely grateful to the spectator, as
the progress seems to be one to eternal delights.
Two of the souls, however, are not freed, but convict;
not escaping, but doomed; not looking hope and
bliss, but despair and utter misery. One of these is
clearly the noble youth whose effigy, without inscription,
appears upon the tomb. He is one of the
Roman intruders. Behind him, following close, is
the evil genius of the Etruscan—represented as a
colossal negro—brutal in all his features, exulting
fiendishly, in his expression of countenance, and with
his claws firmly grasped in the shoulders of his
victim. His brow is twined with serpents in the
manner of a fillet, and his left hand carries the huge
mallet with which the demon was expected to crush,
or bruise and mangle, the prey which was assigned
him. The other unhappy soul, in similar keeping,
is that of a young woman, whose features declare
her to be one of the loveliest of her sex. She is tall
and majestic; her carriage haughty even in her wo,
and her face equally distinguished by the highest
physical beauty, elevated by a majesty and air of
sway, which denoted a person accustomed to the habitual
exercise of her own will. But, through all her
beauty and majesty, there are the proofs of that agony
of soul which passeth show and understanding. Two
big drops of sorrow have fallen, and rest upon her
cheeks, the only tokens which her large Juno-like
eyes seem to have given of the suffering which she
endures. They still preserve their fires undimmed
and undaunted, and leave it rather to the brow, the
lips, and the general features of the face to declare
the keen, unutterable wo that swells within her soul,
triumphant equally over pride and beauty. Nothing
can exceed in force the touching expression of her
agony unutterable, unless in the sympathizing imagination
of him who seeks for the sources of the
painter’s pencil into the very bosom of the artist.
Immediately behind this beautiful and suffering creature
is seen, close following, as in the case of the
Roman youth already described, the gloomy and
brutal demon—the devil of Etruscan superstition—a
negro somewhat less dark and deformed than the
other, and seemingly of the other sex, with looks
less terrible and offensive, but whose office is not
less certain, and whose features are not less full of
exultation and triumph. She does not actually grasp
the shoulders of the victim, but she has her nevertheless
beneath her clutches, and the serpent of her
fillet, with extended head, seems momently ready to
dart its venomous fangs into the white bosom that
shrinks yet swells beneath its eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long, indeed, did this terrible picture fix and fascinate
the eyes of the spectators; and when at length
they turned away, it was only to look back and to
meditate upon the mysterious and significant scene
which it described. In proceeding further, however,
in their search through the “Grotta,” they happened
upon another discovery. They were already aware
that the features of this beautiful woman were Roman
in their type. Indeed, there was no mistaking the
inexpressible majesty of that countenance, which
could belong to no other people. It was not to be
confounded with the Etruscan, which, it must be remembered,
was rather Grecian or Phœnician in its
character, and indicated grace and beauty rather than
strength, subtlety and skill, rather than majesty and
command. But, that there might be no doubt of the
origin of this lovely woman, examining more closely
the effigy upon the sarcophagus first discovered—having
removed the soil from the features, and
brought a strong light to bear upon them—they were
found to be those exactly of the victim thus terribly
distinguished in the painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, then, was a coincidence involving a very
curious mystery. About the facts there could be no
mistake. Two strangers, of remarkable feature, find
their burial, against all usage, in the tumulus of an
ancient Etruscan family. Both are young, of different
sexes, and both are Roman. Their features
are carved above their dust, in immortal marble—we
may almost call it so, which, after two thousand
years, still preserves its trust—and, in an awful procession
of souls to judgment, delineated by a hand of
rare excellence, and with rare precision, we find the
same persons, drawn to the life, and in the custody,
as doomed victims, of the terrible fiend of Etruscan
mythology. To this condition some terrible tale was
evidently attached. Both of these pictures were portraits.
For that matter, all were portraits in the
numerous collection. With those two exceptions,
the rest were of the same family, and their several
fates, according to the resolve of the painter, were
all felicitous. They walked erect, triumphant in
hope and consciousness, elastic in their tread, and
joyous in their features. Not so these two: the outcasts
of the group—<span class='it'>with</span> but not <span class='it'>of</span> them—painfully
contrasted by the artist—terribly so by the doom of
the awful providence whose decree he had ventured
thus freely to declare. The features of the man had
the expression of one whom a just self-esteem moves
to submit in dignity, and without complaint. The
face of the woman, on the contrary, is full of anguish,
though still distinguished by a degree of loftiness and
character to which his offers no pretension. There
were the portraits, and there the effigies, and beneath
them, in their stone coffins, lay the fragments of their
mouldering bones—the relic of two thousand years.
What a scene had the artist chosen to transmit to
posterity—from real life—and with what motive?
By what terrible sense of justice, or by what strange
obliquity of judgment and feeling, did the great Lucumo
of the Pomponii, suffer the members of his
family to be thus offensively perpetuated to all time,
in the place of family sepulture? Could it have been
the inspiration of revenge and hatred, by which this
<span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>
vivid and terrible representation was wrought; and
what was the melancholy history of these two
strangers—so young, so beautiful—thus doomed to
the inexpiable torments of the endless future, by the
bold anticipatory awards of a successor, or a contemporary?
To these questions our explorers of
the “Grotta del Tifoné” did not immediately find an
answer. That they have done so since, the reader
will ascribe to the keen anxiety with which they
have groped through ancient chronicles in search of
an event which, thus wondrously preserved by art
for a period of more than twenty centuries, could not,
as they well conjectured, be wholly obliterated from
all other mortal records.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Etrurian Captive at Rome.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The time had passed when Etruria gave laws to
the rest of Italy. Lars Porsenna was already in his
grave, and his memory, rather than his genius and
spirit, satisfied the Etruscan. The progeny of the She
Wolf<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> had risen into wondrous strength and power,
and so far from shrinking within their walls at the approach
of the vulture of Volterræ, they had succeeded
in clipping her wings, and shortening, if not wholly
arresting her flight. The city of the Seven Hills, looking
with triumph from her eminences, began to claim
all within her scope of vision as her own, and <a id='para'></a>paralyzed
at their audacity, their success, and their wonderful
genius for all the arts of war, the neighboring
cities began to tremble at the assertion of her claims.
But the braver and less prudent spirits of young
Etruria revolted at this assumption, and new wars
followed, which were too fierce and bloody to continue
long. It needs not that we should describe the
varying fortunes of the parties. Enough for our purposes
that, after one well-fought field, in which the
Romans triumphed, they bore away, as a prisoner,
with many others, Cœlius, the youthful Lucumo of
the Pomponian family. This young man, not yet
nineteen, was destined by nature rather for an artist,
than a soldier. He possessed, in remarkable degree,
that talent for painting and statuary, which was
largely the possession of the Etrurians; and, though
belonging to one of the noblest families in his native
city, he did not think it dishonorable to exercise his
talent with industry and devotion. In the invasion
of his country by the fierce barbarians of Rome, he
had thrown aside the pencil for the sword, in the use
of which latter weapon he had shown himself not a
whit less skillful and excellent, because of his preference
for a less dangerous implement. His captivity
was irksome, rather than painful and oppressive.
He was treated with indulgence by his captors,
and quartered for a season in the family of the
fierce chief by whose superior prowess he had been
overthrown. Here, if denied his freedom, and the
use of the sword, he was not denied a resumption of
those more agreeable exercises of art to which he
had devoted himself before his captivity. He consoled
himself in this condition by his favorite studies.
He framed the vase into grace and beauty,
adorned its sides with groups from poetry and history,
and by his labors delighted the uninitiated eyes
of all around him. The fierce warrior in whose custody
he was looked on with a grim sort of satisfaction
at the development of arts, for which his appreciative
faculties were small; and it somewhat lessened
our young Etruscan in his esteem, that he
should take pleasure in such employments. At all
events, the effects, however disparaging, were so
far favorable that they tended to the increase of his
indulgencies. His restraints were fewer, the old
Roman not apprehending much danger of escape, or
much of enterprise, from one whose tastes were so
feminine; and the more gentle regards of the family,
in which he was a guest perforce, contributed still
more to sweeten and soften the asperities of captivity.
As a Lucumo of the first rank in Etruria, he
also claimed peculiar indulgences from a people,
who, conscious of their own inferior origin, were
not by any means insensible to the merits of aristocracy.
Our captive was accordingly treated with a
deference which was as grateful to his condition as
it was the proper tribute to his rank. The wife of
the chief whose captive he was, herself a noble
matron of Rome, was as little insensible to the rank
of the Etrurian, as she was to the equal modesty and
manliness of his deportment. Nor was she alone
thus made aware of his claims and virtues. She
had a son and daughter, the latter named Aurelia, a
creature of the most imposing beauty, of a lofty
spirit and carriage, and of a high and generous ambition.
The brother, Lucius, was younger than herself;
a lad of fifteen, but he, like his sister, became
rapidly and warmly impressed with the grace of
manner and goodness of heart which distinguished
the young Etrurian. They both learned to love him;
the youth, probably, with quite as unreckoning a
warmth as his sister. Nor was the heart of Cœlius
long untouched. He soon perceived the exquisite
beauties of the Roman damsel, and, by the usual unfailing
symptoms, revealed the truth as well to the
family of the maiden as to herself. The mother discovered
the secret with delight, was soon aware of
the condition of her daughter’s heart; and the relations
of the several parties being thus understood, it
was not long before they came to an explanation,
which ended to their mutual satisfaction. Cœlius
was soon released from his captivity, and, to the
astonishment of all his family, returned home, bearing
with him the beautiful creature by whom his
affections had been so suddenly enslaved.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Brother and the Wife.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>His return to Tarquinia was hailed with delight by
every member of his family but one. This was a
younger brother, whose position had been greatly
improved by the absence and supposed death of
Cœlius. He cursed in the bitterness of his heart the
fate which had thus restored, as from the grave, the
shadow which had darkened his own prospects; and
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
though he concealed his mortification under the guise
of a joy as lively as that of any other member of the
household, he was torn with secret hate and the most
fiendish jealousy. At first, however, as these feelings
were quite aimless, he strove naturally to subdue
them. There was no profitable object in their indulgence,
and he was one of those, cunning beyond
his years, who entertain no moods, and commit no
crime, unless with the distinct hope of acquisition.
It required but a little time, however, to ripen other
feelings in his soul, by which the former were rather
strengthened than diminished, and by which all his
first, and, perhaps, feeble efforts to subdue them were
rendered fruitless. In the first bitter mood in which
he beheld the return of his brother, the deep disappointment
which he felt, with the necessity of concealing
his chagrin from every eye, prevented him
from bestowing that attention upon the wife of
Cœlius which her beauty, had his thoughts been free,
must inevitably have commanded. With his return
to composure, however, he soon made the discovery
of her charms, and learned to love them with a passion
scarcely less warm than that which was felt by
her husband. Hence followed a double motive for
hating the latter, and denouncing his better fortune.
Aruns—the name of the younger brother—was, like
Cœlius, a man of great talent and ingenuity; but his
talent, informed rather by his passions than by his
tastes, was addressed to much humbler objects.
While the one was creative and gentle in his character,
the other was violent and destructive; while the
one worshiped beauty for its own sake, the other regarded
it only as subserving selfish purposes. Cœlius
was frank and generous in his temper, Aruns reserved,
suspicious and contracted. The one had no
disguises, the other dwelt within them, even as a
spider girdled by his web, and lying secret in the
crevice at its bottom. Hitherto, his cunning had
been chiefly exercised in concealing itself, in assuming
the <a id='part'></a>part of frankness, in appearing, so far as
he might, the thing that he was not. It was now to
be exercised for his more certain profit, in schemes
hostile to the peace of others. To cloak these designs,
he betrayed more than usual joy at the restoration
of his brother. His, indeed, seemed the most
elated spirit of the household, and the confiding and
unsuspecting Cœlius at once took him to his heart,
with all the warmth and sincerity of boyhood. It
gave him pleasure to perceive that Aurelia, his wife,
received him as a brother, and regarded with delight
the appearance of affection that subsisted between
them. The three soon became more and more united
in their sympathies and objects, and the devotion of
Aruns to the Roman wife of Cœlius was productive
of a gratification to the latter, which he did not endeavor
to conceal. It was grateful to him that his
brother did not leave his wife to that solitude in her
foreign home, which might sometimes have followed
his own too intense devotion to the arts which he
so passionately loved; and, without a fear that his
faith might be misplaced, he left to Aruns the duty
which no husband might prudently devolve upon any
man, of ministering to those tastes and affections, the
most delicate and sacred, which make of every
family circle a temple in which the father, and the
husband, and the master, should alone be the officiating
priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time had passed in this manner, and at length
it struck our Lucumo that there was less cordiality
between his brother and his wife than had pleased
him so much at first. Aurelia now no longer spoke
of Aruns—his name never escaped her lips, unless
when she was unavoidably forced to speak it in
reply. His approaches to her were marked by a
timidity not usual with him, and by a <span class='it'>hauteur</span> in her
countenance which was shown to no other person.
It was a proof of the superior love of Cœlius to his
wife that he reproached her for this seeming dislike.
She baffled his inquiry, met his reproaches with renewed
shows of tenderness, and the fond, confiding
husband resumed his labors on the beautiful, with
perhaps too little regard to what was going on
around him. Meanwhile, the expression in the face
of Aurelia had been gradually deepening into gravity.
Care was clouding her brow, and an air of anxiety
manifested itself upon her cheek—a look of apprehension—as
if some danger were impending—some
great fear threatening in her heart. This continued
for some time, when she became conscious that the
eye of her husband began to be fixed inquiringly
upon her, and with the look of one dissatisfied, if not
doubtful—disturbed if not suspicious—and with certain
sensibilities rendered acute and watchful, which
had been equally confiding and affectionate before.
These signs increased her disquiet, and deepened her
anxiety. But she was silent. The glances of her
husband were full of appeal, but she gave them no
response. She could but retire from his presence,
and sigh to herself in solitude. There was evidently
a mystery in this conduct, and the daily increasing
anxieties of the husband betrayed his doubts that it
might prove a humiliating one at the solution. But
he, too, was silent. His pride forbade that he should
declare himself, when he could only speak of vague
surmises, and perhaps degrading suspicions. He was
silent, but not at ease. His pleasant labors of the
studio were abandoned. Was it for relief from his
own thoughts that he was now so frequently in company
with Aruns, or did he hope to obtain from the
latter, any clue to the mystery which disturbed his
household? It was not in the art of Aurelia so to
mould the expression of her countenance, as to hide
from others the anxiety which she felt in the increasing
and secret communion of the brothers. She
watched their departure with dread, and witnessed
their return together with agitation. She saw, or
fancied she saw, in the looks of the younger a malignant
exultation, which even his habitual cunning
did not suffer him entirely to conceal.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_4'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>The Secret Picture.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the cloud seemed to clear away from the
brow of her husband. He once more resumed his
labors, and with an eagerness and an avidity which
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
he had not betrayed before. His passion now
amounted to intensity. He gave himself no respite
from his labors. Late and early he was at his task—morning
and night—without intermission, and
with the enthusiasm of one who rejoices in the completion
of a favorite and long-cherished study. Aurelia
was not unhappy at this second change; to go
back to his old engagements and tastes seemed to her
to indicate a return to his former equanimity and
waveless happiness. It was with some surprise,
however, and not a little concern, that she was not
now permitted to watch his progress. He wrought in
secret—his studio was closed against her, as, indeed,
it was against all persons. Hitherto it had not been
so in her instance. She pleasantly reproached him
for this seclusion, but he answered her—“fear not,
you shall see all when it is done.” There was something
in this reply to disquiet her, but she was in a
state of mind easily to be disquieted. She was conscious
also of a secret withheld from her husband—and
her reproaches sunk back upon her heart, unuttered,
from her lips. She could not, because of what
she felt, declare to him what she thought; and she
beheld his progress, from day to day, with an apprehension
that increased momently, and made her appearance,
in one respect, not unlike his own. She
was now aware that he was the victim of a strange
excitement, in which his present artist labors had a
considerable share. He seemed to hurry to their
prosecution with an eager impatience that looked
like frenzy—and to return from his daily task with a
frame exhausted, but with an eye that seemed to
burn with the subtlest fires. His words were few,
but there was a strange intelligence in his looks. His
cheeks had grown very pale, his frame was thinned,
his voice hollow, in the prosecution of these secret
labors; and yet there was a something of exultation
in his glance, which fully declared that, however
exhausting to his frame might be the task he was
pursuing, its results were yet looked to with a wild
and eager satisfaction. At length the work was
done. One day he stood before her in an attitude of
utter exhaustion. “It is finished!” he exclaimed.
“You shall see it to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, to-morrow! to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then retired to sleep, and rested several hours.
She looked on him while he slept. He had never
rested so profoundly since he had begun the labor
from which he was now freed. The slumber of an
infant had never been less disturbed, never been
softer, sweeter, or purer. The beauty of Cœlius
was that of the most peaceful purity. She bent over
him as he slept, and kissed his forehead with looks
of the truest devotion, while two big tears gathered
in her large eyes, and slowly felt their way along
her cheeks. She turned away lest the warm drops
falling upon his face might awake him. She turned
away, and in her own apartment gave free vent to
the feelings which his pure and placid slumbers
seemed rather to subdue than encourage. Why,
with such a husband—her first love—and with so
many motives to happiness, was she not happy?
Alas! who shall declare for the secret yearnings of
the heart, and say, as idly as Canute to the sea,
“thus far shalt thou go, and no farther—here shall
thy proud waves be stayed.” Aurelia was a creature
of fears and anxieties, and many a secret and sad
presentiment. She was very far from happy—ill at
ease—and—but why anticipate? We shall soon
enough arrive at the issue of our melancholy narrative!</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, while she slept—for grief and apprehension
have their periods of exhaustion, which we
misname repose—her husband rose from his couch,
and with cautious footsteps departed from his dwelling.
He was absent all the night, and returned only
with the dawn. He re-entered his home with the
same stealthy caution with which he had quitted it,
and it might have been remarked that he dismissed
his brother, with two other persons, at the threshold.
They were all masked, and otherwise disguised with
cloaks. Why this mystery? Where had they been—on
what mission of mischief or of shame? To
Cœlius such a necessity was new, and scarcely had
he entered his dwelling than he cast aside his disguises
with the air of one who loathes their uses.
He was very pale and haggard, with a fixed but glistening
expression of the eye, a brow of settled gloom,
from which hope and faith, and every interest in
life seemed utterly to be banished. A single groan
escaped him when he stood alone, and then he raised
himself erect, as if hitherto he had leaned upon the
arms of others. He carried himself firmly and loftily,
his lips compressed, his eye eagerly looking forward,
and thus, after the interval of a few seconds, he passed
to the chamber of his wife. And still she slept. He
bent over her, earnestly and intently gazing upon
those beauties which grief seemed only to sadden
into superior sweetness. He looked upon her with
those earnest eyes of love, the expression of which
can never be misunderstood. Still he loved her,
though between her heart and his a high, impassable
barrier had been raised up by the machinations of a
guilty spirit. Tenderness was the prevailing character
of his glance until she spoke. Her sleep, though
deep, was not wholly undisturbed. Fearful images
crossed her fancy. She started and sobbed, and
cried, “Save, O save and spare him—Flavius, my
dear Flavius!”—and her breathing again became
free, and her lips sunk once more into repose. But
fearful was the change, from a saddened tenderness
to agony and despair, which passed over the features
of Cœlius as he listened to her cry. Suddenly, striking
his clenched hands against his forehead, he shook
them terribly at the sleeping woman, and rushed
wildly out of the apartment.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Progress to the Sepulchre.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was noon of the same day—a warm and sunny
noon, in which the birds and the breeze equally
counseled pleasure and repose. The viands stood
before our Cœlius and his wife, the choicest fruits
of Italy, and cates which might not, in later days,
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
have misbeseemed the favorite chambers of Lucullus.
The goblet was lifted in the hands of both, and the
heart of Aurelia felt almost as cheerful as the expression
on her face. It was the reflection in the face of
her husband. His brow was gloomy no longer. The
tones of his voice were neither cold, nor angry, nor
desponding. A change—she knew not why—had
come over his spirit, and he smiled, nay, laughed out,
in the very exultation of a new life. Aurelia conjectured
nothing of this so sudden change. Enough
that it was grateful to her soul. She was too happy
in its influence to inquire into its cause. What heart
that is happy does inquire? She quaffed the goblet
at his bidding—quaffed it to the dregs—and her eye
gleamed delighted and delightfully upon his, even as
in the first hours of their union. She had no apprehensions—dreaded
nothing sinister—and did not perceive
that ever, at the close of his laughter, there
was a convulsive quiver—a sort of hysterical sobbing,
that he seemed to try to subdue in vain. She
noticed not this, nor the glittering, almost spectral
brightness of his glance, as, laughing tumultuously,
he still kept his gaze intently fixed upon her. She
was blind to all things but the grateful signs of his
returning happiness and attachment. Once more
the goblet was lifted. “To Turmes (Mercury) the
conductor,” cried the husband. The wife drank unwittingly—for
still her companion smiled upon her,
and spoke joyfully, and she was as little able as
willing to perceive that any thing occult occured in
his expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you drank?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled, and laid the empty goblet before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, then, you shall now behold the picture.
You will now be prepared to understand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rose together, but another change had overspread
his features. The gayety had disappeared
from his face. It was covered with a calm that
was frightful. The eye still maintained all its eager
intensity, but the lips were fixed in the icy mould of
resolution. They declared a deep, inflexible purpose.
There was a corresponding change in his manner
and deportment. But a moment before he was all
life, grace, gayety and great flexibility; he was now
erect, majestic, and commanding in aspect, with a
lordly dignity in his movement, that declared a sense
of a high duty to be done. Aurelia was suddenly
impressed with misgivings. The change was too
sudden not to startle. Her doubts and apprehensions
were not lessened when, instead of conducting her
to the studio, where she expected to see the picture,
he led the way through the vestibule and into the
open court of the palace. They lingered but for a moment
at the entrance, and she then beheld his brother
Aruns approaching. To him she gave not a look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All is right,” said the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter!” was the reply of Cœlius; and as the
brother disappeared within the vestibule, the two
moved forward through the outer gate. They passed
through a lovely wood, shady and hidden, through
which, subdued by intervening leaves, gleamed only
faintly the bright, clear sun of Italy. From under
the huge chestnuts, on either hand, the majestic gods
of Etruria extended their guiding and endowing hands.
Tina, or Jupiter, Aplu, or Apollo, Erkle, Turmes,
and the rest, all conducting them along the <span class='it'>via sacre</span>,
which led from the palaces to the tombs of every
proud Etruscan family. They entered the solemn
grove which was dedicated to night and silence, and
were about to ascend the gradual slopes by which
the tumulus was approached. Then it was that the
misgivings of Aurelia took a more serious form. She
felt a vague but oppressive fear. She hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Cœlius,” she exclaimed, “whither do we go.
Is not this the passage to the house of silence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not know it?” he demanded quickly, and
fixing upon her a keen inquiring glance. “Come!”
he continued, “it is there that I have fixed the
picture!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! my Cœlius, wherefore! It is upon this
picture that you have been so deeply engaged. It
has made you sad—it has left us both unhappy. Let
us not go—let me not see it!” Her agitation was
greatly increased. He saw it, and his face put on a
look of desperate exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, but thou must see it—thou shalt look upon it
and behold my triumph, my greatest triumph in art,
and perhaps my last. I shall never touch pencil more,
and wilt thou refuse to look upon my last and noblest
work. Fie! this were a wrong to me, and a great
shame in thee, Aurelia. Come! the toil of which
thou think’st but coldly, has brought me peace rather
than sadness. It has made of death a thing rather
familiar than offensive. If it has deprived me of hopes,
it has left me without terrors!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deprived you of hopes, my Cœlius,” said the
wife, still lingering, and in mortal terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, wherefore, O, my husband, wherefore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak not, woman! See you not that we are
within the shadow of the tomb?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us not approach—let us go hence!” she
exclaimed entreatingly, with increasing agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, shrink’st thou!” he answered; “well thou
may’st. The fathers of the Pomponii, for two thousand
years, are now floating around us on their
sightless wings. They wonder that a Roman woman
should draw nigh to the dwellings of our ancient
Lucumones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Roman woman!” she exclaimed reproachfully.
“My Cœlius, wherefore this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Art thou not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thy wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Art sure of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the gods live and look upon us, I am thine,
this hour and forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the gods judge thee, woman,” he responded
slowly, as he paused at the gate of the mausoleum,
and fixed his eyes intently upon her. Hers were
raised to heaven, with her uplifted hands. She did
not weep, and her grief was still mixed with a fearful
agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us now return, my Cœlius!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, wilt thou not behold the picture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now—at another season. I could not look
upon it now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>
“Alas! woman, but this cannot be. Thou must
behold it now or never. Hope not to escape. Enter!
I have a tale to tell thee, and a sight to show thee
within, which thou canst not hear or see hereafter.
Enter!” As he spoke, he applied the key to the stone
leaf, and the door slowly revolved upon the massy
pivots. She turned and would have fled, but he
grasped her by the wrist, and moved toward the
entrance. She carried her freed hand to her forehead—parted
the hair from her eyes, and raised them
pleadingly to heaven. Resistance she saw was vain.
Her secret was discovered. She prepared to enter,
but slowly. “Enter! Dost thou fear now,” cried
her husband, “when commanded? Hast thou not,
thou, a Roman, ventured already to penetrate these
awful walls, given to silence and the dead—and on
what mission? Enter, as I bid thee!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'><span class='it'>The Chamber of Death—The Catastrophe.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>She obeyed him, shuddering and silent. He followed
her, closed the entrance, and fastened it
within. They were alone among the dead of a thousand
years—alone, but not in darkness. The hand
of preparation had been there, and cressets were
burning upon the walls; their lights, reflected from
the numerous shields of bronze within the apartment,
shedding a strange and fantastic splendor upon the
scene. The eyes of Aurelia rapidly explored the
chamber as if in search of some expected object.
Those of Cœlius watched them with an expression
of scornful triumph, which did not escape her glance.
She firmly met his gaze, almost inquiringly, while
her hands were involuntarily and convulsively clasped
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom dost thou seek, Aurelia?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou know’st! thou know’st!—where is he?
Tell me, my Cœlius, that he is safe, that thou hast
sped him hence—that I may bless thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled significantly as he replied, “He is safe—I
have sped him hence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tinai, (Adonai,) my husband, keep thee in the
hollow of his hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shameless! dost thou dare so much!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What mean’st thou, my Cœlius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit thou there,” he answered, “till I show thee
my picture.” He pointed her, as he spoke, to a new
sarcophagus, upon which she placed herself submissively.
Then, with a wand in his hand, he, himself
seated upon another coffin of stone, pointed her
to a curtain which covered one of the sides of the
chamber. “Behind that curtain, Aurelia, is the last
work of my hands; but before I unveil it to thine
eyes, let me tell thee its melancholy history. It will
not need many words for this. Much of it is known
to thee already. How I found thee in Rome, when
I was there a captive—how I loved thee, and how
I believed in thy assurances of love; all these things
thou know’st. We wedded, and I brought thee, a
Roman woman, held a barbarian by my people, into
the palace of one of the proudest families of all Etruria.
Shall I tell thee that I loved thee still, that I love thee
even now, when I have most reason to hate thee,
when I know thy perjury, thy cold heart, thy hot
lust, thy base, degrading passions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold, my lord—say not these things to my grief
and thy dishonor. They wrong me, not less than
thy own name. These things, poured into thine ear
by some secret enemy, are false!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wilt not swear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By all the gods of Rome—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of what avail, and how binding the oath taken
in the names of the barbarian deities of Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the Etrurian—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perjure not thyself, woman, but hear me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, my lord, I will hear thee, though I suffer
death with every word thou speak’st.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well, Aurelia, that thou art prepared for
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy dagger, my Cœlius, were less painful than
thy words and looks unkind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was I unkind until I found thee false.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was I false, my lord, even when thou
wast unkind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman! lie not; thou wert discovered with thy
paramour, here, in this tomb; thou wert followed, day
by day, and all thy secret practices betrayed. This
thou ow’st to the better vigilance of my dear brother
Aruns—he, more watchful of my honor than myself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! well I know from what hand came the cruel
shaft; Cœlius, my Cœlius, thy brother is a wretch,
doomed to infamy and black with crime. I have had
no paramour. I might have had, and thou might’st have
been dishonored, had I hearkened to thy brother’s
pleadings. I spurned him from my feet with loathing,
and he requites me with hate. Oh! my husband,
believe me, and place this man, whom thou too
fondly callest thy brother, before thine eyes and
mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! Aurelia, this boldness becomes thee not.
I myself traced thee to this tomb—these eyes but too
frequently beheld thee with thy paramour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cœlius, as I live, he was no paramour—but
where is he, what hast thou done with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sent him before thee to prepare thy coach in
Hades!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, brother!—but thou hast not! tell me, my
lord, that thy hand is free from this bloody crime!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sleeps beneath thee. It is upon his sarcophagus
thou sittest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started with a piercing shriek from the coffin
where she sat, knelt beside it, and strove to remove
the heavy stone lid, which had been already securely
fastened. While thus engaged the Lucumo drew
aside with his hand the curtain which concealed
the picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” said he, “woman, behold the fate which
thou and thy paramour have received—behold the
task which I had set me when first I had been shown
thy perjuries. Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She arose in silence from her knees, and turned
her eyes upon the picture. As the curtain was
slowly unrolled from before it, and she conceived
the awful subject, and distinguished, under the care
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>
of the good and guardian genii, the shades of well-known
members of the Pomponian family, her interest
was greatly excited; but when following in
the train and under the grasp of the Etrurian demon,
she beheld the features of the young Roman who was
doomed, she bounded forward with a cry of agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother, my Flavius, my own, my only
brother!” and sunk down with outstretched arms
before the melancholy shade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her brother!” exclaimed the husband. She
heard the words and rose rapidly to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, Flavius, my brother, banished from Rome,
and concealed here in thy house of silence, concealed
even from thee, my husband, as I would not
vex thee with the anxieties of an Etrurian noble, lest
Rome should hear and punish the people, by whom
her outlaw was protected. Thou know’st my crime.
This paramour was the brother of my heart—child
of the same sire and dame—a noble heart, a pure
spirit, whose very virtues have been the cause of his
disgrace at Rome. Slay me, if thou wilt, but tell me
not, O, Cœlius, that thou hast put the hands of hate
upon my brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy tale is false, woman—well-planned, but
false. Know I not thy brother? Did I not know thy
brother well in Rome? Went we not together oft?
I tell thee, I should know him among a line of ten
thousand Romans!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! alas! my husband, if ever I had brother,
then is this he. I tell thee nothing but the truth. Of
a surety, when thou wert in Rome, my brother was
known to thee, but the boy has now become a man.
Seven years have wrought a change upon him of
which thou hast not thought. Believe me, what I
tell thee—the youth whom I sheltered in this vault,
and to whom I brought food nightly, was, indeed,
my brother—my Flavius, the only son of my mother,
who sent him to me, with fond words of entreaty,
when the consuls of the city bade him depart in
banishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot believe thee, woman. It were a mortal
agony, far beyond what I feel in the conviction of
thy guilt, were I to yield faith to thy story. It is thy
paramour whom I have slain, and who sleeps in that
tomb. His portrait and his judgment are before thee,
and now—look on thine own!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture, fully displayed, showed to the wretched
woman her own person, in similar custody with
him who was her supposed paramour. The terrible
felicity of the execution struck her to the soul. It
was a picture to live as a work of art, and to this
she was not insensible. She clasped her hands before
it, and exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! my Cœlius, what a life hast thou <a id='given'></a>given to a
lie. Yet may I bear the terrors of such a doom, if
he whom thou hast painted there in a fate full of
dreadful fellowship with mine, was other than my
brother Flavius—he with whom thou did’st love to
play, and to whom thou did’st impart the first lessons
in the art which he learned to love from thee. Dost
hear me, my Cœlius, as my soul lives, this man was
none other than my brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“False! false! I will not, dare not believe thee!”
he answered in husky accents. His frame was
trembling, yet he busied himself in putting on a rich
armor, clothing himself in military garb, from head
to foot, as if going into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What dost thou, my lord?” demanded Aurelia,
curious as she beheld him in this occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said he, “is the armor in which I fought
with Rome when I was made the captive of thy
people, and thine. It is fit that I should wear it now,
when I am once more going into captivity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband, what mean’st thou—of what captivity
dost thou speak?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The captivity of death! Hear me, Aurelia, dost
thou feel nothing at thy heart which tells thee of the
coming struggle when the soul shakes off the reluctant
flesh, and strives, as it were, for freedom. Is there
no chill in thy veins, no sudden pang, as of fire in
thy breast. These speak in me. They warn me of
death. We are both summoned. But a little while
is left us of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have mercy, Jove! I feel these pains, this chill,
this fire that thou speak’st of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is death! the goblet which I gave thee, and of
which I drank the first and largest draught was drugged
with death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—it is all true! Thou hast in truth slain my
brother. Thou hast—thou hast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, he was not thy brother, Aurelia. Why
wilt thou forswear thyself at this terrible moment?
It is vain. Would’st thou lie to death—would’st thou
carry an impure face of perjury before the seat of
the Triune God! Beware! Confess thy crime, and
justify the vengeance of thy lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I believe thee, my Cœlius—as I believe that
thou hast most rashly and unjustly murdered my
brother, and put death in the cup which, delivered
by thy hands, was sweet and precious to my lips, so
must I now declare, in sight of Heaven, in the presence
of the awful dead, that what I have said and
sworn to thee, is truth. He whom I sheltered within
the tombs of thy fathers, was the son of mine—the
only, the last, best brother of my heart; I bore him
in mine arms when I was a child myself. I loved
him ever! Oh, how I loved him! next to thee, my
Cœlius—next to thee! Could’st thou but have spared
me this love—this brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How knew I—how know I now—that he was thy
brother?” was the choking inquiry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To save thee the cruel agony that thou must feel,
knowing this, I could even be moved to tell thee
falsely, and say that he was not my brother—but,
indeed, some paramour, such as the base and evil
thought of thy brother has grafted upon thine; but I
may not, thy love is too precious to me at this last
moment, even if death were not too terrible to the
false speaker. He was, indeed, my Flavius, dear
son of a dear mother, best beloved brother, he whom
thou did’st play with as a boy, to whom thou gav’st
lessons in thy own lovely art; who loved thee, my
Cœlius, but too fondly, and only forbore telling thee
of his evil plight for fear that thou should’st incur
danger from the sharp and angry hostility of Rome.
Seek my chamber, and in my cabinet thou wilt find
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
his letters, and the letters of my mother, borne with
him in his flight. Nay,—oh! mother, what is this
agony?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too late! too late! If it be truth thou speakest,
Aurelia, it is a truth that cannot save. Death is upon
us—I see it in thy face—I feel it in my heart. Oh!
would that I could doubt thy story!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubt not—doubt not—believe and take me to
thy heart. I fear not death, if thou wilt believe me.
My Cœlius, let me come to thee and die upon thy
bosom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! should’st thou betray me—should’st thou
still practice upon me with thy woman art!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wherefore? It is death, thou say’st, that is
upon us now. What shall I gain, in this hour, by
speaking to thee falsely. Thou hast done thy worst.
Thou hast doomed me to death, and to the eyes of
the confiding future!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw her arms around him as she spoke, and
sunk, sunk sobbing upon his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he exclaimed, “that dreadful picture! I
feel, my Aurelia, that thou hast spoken truly—that
I have been rash and cruel in my judgments. Thy
brother lies before thee, and yonder tomb is prepared
for thee. I did not yield without a struggle; and I
prepared me for a terrible sacrifice. Upon this bier,
habited as I am, I yield myself to death. There is
no help—no succor. Yet that picture! Shall the
falsehood overcome the truth? Shall that lie survive
thy virtues, thy beauty, and thy life! No! my
Aurelia, this crime shall be spared at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unwound her arms from about his neck, and
strove to rise. She sunk in the same moment at his
feet. “Oh, death!” she cried, “thou art, indeed, a
god! I feel thee, terrible in thy strength, with an
agony never felt before. Leave me not, my Cœlius—forgive—and
leave me not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lose thee, Aurelia! Where—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! before the couch—I faint—ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would destroy,” he cried, “but cannot! This
blindness. Ho! without there! Aruns! It is thy
step I hear! Undo, undo—I forgive thee all, if thou
wilt but help. Here—hither!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The acute senses of the dying man had, indeed,
heard footsteps without. They were those of the
perfidious brother. But, at the call from within, he
retreated hastily. There was no answer—there was
no help. But there was still some consciousness.
Death was not yet triumphant. There was a pang
yet to be felt—and a pleasure. It was still in the
power of the dying man to lift to his embrace his
innocent victim. A moment’s return of consciousness
enabled her to feel his embrace, his warm tears
upon her cheek, and to hear his words of entreaty
and tenderness imploring forgiveness. And speech
was vouchsafed her to accord it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgive thee, my Cœlius—I forgive thee, and
bless thee, and love thee to the last. I know that
thou would’st never do me hurt of thy own will; I
know that thou wert deceived to this—yet how, oh,
how, when my head lay upon thy breast at night,
and I slept in peace, could’st thou think that I should
do thee wrong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” murmured the miserable man, “why, oh,
why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had I but told thee, and trusted in thee, my
Cœlius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did’st thou not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was because of my brother’s persuasion that I
did not—he wished not that thou should’st come to
evil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thou forgiv’st me, Aurelia—from thy very
heart thou forgiv’st me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All, all—from my heart and soul, my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will not, then, be very hard to die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour after and the chamber was silent. The
wife had yielded first. She breathed her last sigh
upon his bosom, and with the last effort of his
strength he lifted her gently and laid her in the
sarcophagus, composing with affectionate care the
drapery around her. Then, remembering the picture,
he looked around him for his sword with
which to obliterate the portraits which his genius had
assigned to so lamentable an eternity; but his efforts
were feeble, and the paralysis of death seized him
while he was yet making them. He sunk back with
palsied limbs upon the bier, and the lights, and the
picture, faded from before his eyes, with the last
pulses of his life. The calumny which had destroyed
his hopes, survived its own detection. The recorded
falsehood was triumphant over the truth; yet may
you see to this day, where the random strokes of the
weapon were aimed for its obliteration. Of himself
there is no monument in the tomb, though one
touching memorial has reached us. The vaulted
chamber buried in the earth was discovered by accident.
A fracture was made in its top by an Italian
gentleman in company with a Scottish nobleman.
As they gazed eagerly through the aperture, they
beheld an ancient warrior in full armor, and bearing
a coronet of gold. The vision lasted but a moment.
The decomposing effects of the air were soon perceptible.
Even while they gazed, the body seemed
agitated with a trembling, heaving motion, which
lasted a few minutes, and then it subsided into dust.
When they penetrated the sepulchre, they found the
decaying armor in fragments, the sword and the
helmet, or crown of gold. The dust was but a handful,
and this was all that remained of the wretched Lucumo.
The terrible picture is all that survives—the
false witness, still repeating its cruel lie at
the expense of all that is noble in youth and manhood,
and all that is pure and lovely in the soul of
woman.</p>

<p class='line'>I have thoughts that bow me to the dust in stupor-like despair,</p>
<p class='line'>That bind my soul with fetters to keep it always there;</p>
<p class='line'>That whisper I can never rise, that my spirit has no wings,</p>
<p class='line'>But must ever be content to lie amid earth’s blighted things.</p>

<p class='line'>I have gentle, holy thoughts that come with sweet and soothing power</p>
<p class='line'>Instilling vigor in my heart, as dew upon the flower;</p>
<p class='line'>And then I feel that I would give the world if I could be</p>
<p class='line'>From all of human frailty and earthly passion free.</p>
<p class='line'>I have thoughts that breathe unholy air, that bring a chilling blight</p>
<p class='line'>Upon each better feeling, each principle of right:</p>
<p class='line'>Vain, foolish, envious, wicked thoughts that fill my heart with pain;</p>
<p class='line'>That pour wild tumult in my breast, and fever on my brain.</p>

<p class='line'>And some who at another time might seem but friends in name,</p>
<p class='line'>Are made by those same gentle thoughts a friendship true to claim.</p>
<p class='line'>I think me of the kindly deeds, the pleasant word or smile,</p>
<p class='line'>Which sometimes served in sadder hours a sorrow to beguile;</p>
<p class='line'>Oh, then I raise my heart in prayer for every one I know,</p>
<p class='line'>And ask our common God to bless and shield them from each wo;</p>
<p class='line'>And there is naught of sacrifice too great for me to bear,</p>
<p class='line'>If so I might but glad their hearts, or free their souls from care.</p>

<p class='line'>That recall forgotten mem’ries to a gloomy, clouded mind,</p>
<p class='line'>Of broken friendships, trusts betrayed, and words and looks unkind.</p>
<p class='line'>Ah, then suspicion dark and drear spreads forth her chilling blight,</p>

<p class='line'>Bright hopes of future happiness—sweet friendships held most dear.</p>
<p class='line'>And I seem to live ’mid shattered wrecks, in strange, unearthly fear;</p>
<p class='line'>And I start to hear a kindly word, and my spirit dreads a smile,</p>
<p class='line'>Lest the word should be deceitful, or the smile be meant in guile:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OR THE NABOB UNCLE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY AGNES L. GORDON.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, girls, prepare your sweetest smiles, and
best behavior, for your uncle has arrived at last, and
I have just received this note, dated at the Astor,
announcing his coming, and accepting my invitation
to make our house his home; so, to use his own expression,
we may expect him, ‘bag and baggage,’
this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words were addressed by Mrs. Medway to
her daughters, as they sat at breakfast, in an elegant
apartment in a fashionable street up town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means, I suppose, that he comes with an
ebony serving-man, in an immense turban, half a
dozen hookahs, innumerable packages, and self-indulging
contrivances, and all the et cæteras of an
eastern nabob,” replied Matilda. “I wonder where
we are to stow away all the trash that he will undoubtedly
pour in upon us? I wish, mamma, you
had not invited him here; but if his coming prove
but a golden one to us, I, for one, am perfectly willing
to play the agreeable, with so bright a prospect
in store.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so with me,” exclaimed her younger sister
Sophy, “I am determined to do as I please, and not
be like an automaton, at the will of a cross old invalid,
as I have no doubt he is. I suppose we must
have great fires built up all summer, and be content
to be baked, and browned to crisps, in ovens of
rooms, while old yellow-face shivers with cold, and
swears at the climate. And then we must live on
curries, and spices, and pilaus, and all sorts of horrid
nauseous messes, until we are as yellow and bilious
as himself. I boldly protest against all such proceedings,
and thus, once for all, good people, declare
myself free and independent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But recollect, girls,” said their mother, while she
laughed at Sophy’s declaration, “he is your father’s
brother, and as such entitled to at least an appearance
of respect. I wish he was less afflicted to be
sure, for it will be a sad drawback, I fear, upon your
amusements; but keep up your courage, and remember
that to be co-heiresses of an Indian nabob is a
distinction very much to be coveted, and worthy
some sacrifices to attain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure his deafness will be a great relief to
us all,” chimed in Matilda, “so as we play propriety
and have plenty of delicate attentions, and wreathed
smiles, in readiness, we can indulge once in a while
in a theatrical aside of impatience, which will be
quite a safety valve to the temper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if he is an invalid he must necessarily be
cross,” answered Sophy, “and as his sight is impaired,
he will probably want some one to read to
him; <span class='it'>that</span> task I absolutely refuse to perform; for as
to reading any thing more than the last magazine, it
is an effort I never was equal to. We will appoint
Grace reader to his Indian majesty. What say
you, Grace, are you not overwhelmed with the
honor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This question was addressed to a quiet girl, who
had hitherto taken no part in the conversation, but
who replied with a smile, “If your uncle is in reality
the disagreeable person you describe, I shall not be
emulous of the honor you design me; but if he is in
truth an invalid, I will wait on him with cheerfulness,
for you know I am accustomed to a sick
chamber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just like you, Grace, always ready and
willing to do for every one,” answered Sophy. “Of
course he is an invalid—all nabobs are. He has the
gout, and we must all creep on tip-toe about the
room, lest an unlucky jar might give him a twinge,
and bring down a volley, not of blessings, upon our
devoted heads. Then the liver complaint is a necessary
appendage, and blue pills and calomel will
abound. Bah! what a house it will be to be sure, I
should not wonder if he has a pet monkey and half
a dozen macaws, and we shall have a menagerie and
hospital combined. If such <span class='it'>is</span> the case, I shall run
off and get married; so don’t wonder if some morning
I am missing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And thus forfeit your claim to the fortune in
store,” said her sister; “for my part I am willing to
take a pill every other day, in the hope that it will
prove at last a gilded one, and will feed the macaws
to a surfeit—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact, kill them with kindness,” interrupted
Sophy, laughing. “Well, you are welcome to all
you can get, the pill will be bitter if it <span class='it'>is</span> gilded; I
love my ease too well to be shackled even with
golden fetters; so Grace and you may divide the
labor and the reward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace will of course do whatever is required of
her,” said Mrs. Medway gravely, “but as she has
no claim of kindred upon your uncle, she will not
expect any other return than my approval. And
now girls we have spent a long time chatting; I
must go and prepare for our newly arrived relative’s
coming, and remember, Sophy, that you treat him
with all deference and respect; you might have a
little natural feeling—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All fudge, mamma,” laughed Sophy, rising from
her seat; “talk of natural feeling, indeed, for a
cross old <a id='fid'></a>fidgety fellow one never saw, and scarcely
ever heard of, except when he sent you that superb
India shawl. I tell you, mamma, it is a natural feeling
for his presents and his rupees that inspires you
and Matilda; I will none of them except they come
in a <span class='it'>natural</span> way, without any force put on my inclination.
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
You know I am a little Pickle, and I intend
to be as sour as vinegar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I as sweet as honey-water,” cried Matilda,
as she left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and as insipid, too,” replied her sister, following.
“As for you, Grace,” she added, looking
back, “as you fortunately have no selfish considerations,
you can afford to be, as you always are,
‘Simple Grace, gracious and graceful,’” so saying,
the noisy girl slammed the door after her, leaving
Grace to her daily duty of washing the breakfast
things, and arranging the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Medway was the widow of a merchant who
had left his family possessed of a moderate income,
which they contrived should, like a thin plate of gold,
cover a large surface. They lived up to their means
in every sense. Mrs. Medway gave parties, kept
several servants, lived in a large house, showily
furnished, and dressed herself and daughters splendidly.
All this could not be done without strict
economy somewhere; and while the soirées of Mrs.
Medway were pronounced delightful, the servants
made many complaints of their daily fare. Mrs.
Medway was only one of a class; there are hundreds
who, to use a vulgar phrase, “rob Peter to pay Paul,”
and fast at home, that they may appear to feast
abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coming of Jacob Medway, an elder brother
of her husband, who had spent his life in India, and
now returned to his native land, to enjoy his fortune
and find an heir, was an important event to Mrs. Medway.
She would rather, to be sure, have him unacquainted
with certain parts of her household arrangement,
but she hoped to reap a golden harvest, and
wished to give her daughters an opportunity of ingratiating
themselves in his favor. These daughters
were handsome, showy girls. Matilda, the elder,
had been a decided belle for several seasons. She
was tall and slender, with very fine dark eyes, rather
long face, and that distinguished air and manner that
stamps the woman of fashion. She was very anxious
to secure her uncle’s favor, for she argued that a
fine fortune might secure her the alliance that her
fine person had hitherto failed to win.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The younger daughter, Sophy, with less beauty
than her sister, was still much admired. She had a
rattling, dashing way of saying pert, and sometimes
shrewd things, that passed for wit, among the idlers
who surrounded her, though they often winced under
the keenness of her remarks. She was not amiable,
but possessed a sturdy independence that was a redeeming
trait, and though often displaying it in a
most disagreeable manner, was in reality much less
selfish than her soft-lipped sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other inmate of the family whom we have
mentioned, was Grace Addison—“little Grace,” as
she was wont to be affectionately termed in her own
happy home, but now, “Simple Grace,” as Sophy
loved to call her. The mother of Grace was a
cousin of Mrs. Medway; she had been left a widow
in very straitened circumstances, her husband dying
when Grace was just fifteen. Grief and anxiety
threw her in a consumption, and she died two years
after, leaving her orphan child to the care of her
cousin, Mrs. Medway, who had herself been tenderly
reared under the roof of Mrs. Addison’s father, and
upon whom the grand-daughter of her benefactor
certainly had a claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Medway was a selfish woman, and the
charge was irksome, but the circumstances of her
own early life and adoption were so extensively
known, that she dared not brave the censure of her
friends by refusing it; and thus whilst Grace was
ostensibly cared and provided for, she was made to
feel her dependence, and had resolved in her own
heart to seize the first opportunity of releasing her
self from this thraldom, preferring to earn her daily
bread, than to receive it as a favor while she toiled
for it as a menial. But her gentle and pliant nature
dreaded to offend or grieve Mrs. Medway, for she
knew that she was really essential to her, whilst for
Sophy, rude as she at times appeared, she felt a warm
attachment, for she alone acted toward her as an
equal and a friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace Addison was not beautiful, but she had
charms enough to have made her a dangerous rival,
had she appeared on equal terms with the sisters.
She shrunk, however, from society, and seldom appeared
at Mrs. Medway’s <span class='it'>soirées</span>, very much, it
must be confessed, to that lady’s satisfaction. We
have said Grace was not beautiful—lovely is the
epithet properly belonging to her. Scarcely above
the middle height, her slender form was inexpressibly
graceful in all its attitudes; there were no angles
about her, Sophy said. Every accidental position
was a study for a sculptor—and never was the
gentle name of Grace more fitly applied. Her
deep, thoughtful blue eyes were shaded by long
black lashes, that rested on a cheek whose deepest
tint never exceeded the glow on the lip of a sea-shell,
and the delicate features, and rich mass of dark hair,
gave that air of refinement so rare and so <a id='inde'></a>indescribable.
Such was the family of which the nabob,
Jacob Medway, was expected to become an inmate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Mrs. Medway’s drawing-room the family was
assembled to receive the expected guest. Sophy
was ridiculing her sister, and imitating the welcome
which she said Matilda had learned by rote, when
the noise of carriage-wheels were heard, and presently
a loud ring of the bell announced the arrival.
Mrs. Medway arose, and went into the hall, and
then came the sound of trunks unstrapped, and packages
thrown in, and next, enveloped in cloaks, the
rich uncle stepped from the carriage, and being welcomed
by Mrs. Medway, was shown at once to his
room, where every accommodation for his comfort
had been made. He had a colored servant, and as
many packages as even Matilda expected, but no pet
monkey or macaws as yet appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mamma, what is he like?” exclaimed
both daughters in a breath, as she re-entered the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall judge for yourselves presently,” she
answered. “He does not appear to be gouty, however,
for he stepped quite firmly into the hall, and
his voice is pleasant and not at all cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>
“So, perhaps, Matilda will not have the gratification
of being a martyr after all,” cried Sophy, laughing;
“her honey-water will sour by keeping, and
my vinegar become flat; well, after all, I am a little
disappointed. I don’t believe he is at all rich,
Matilda, unless he is gouty, cross, and every thing
bad; it would be too much of a good thing if he were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matilda did not much relish her sister’s raillery,
and a sharp reply rose to her lips as the door opened
and her uncle entered. Mrs. Medway immediately
rose, and introduced him to her daughters, and
Grace offered him the arm-chair which he politely
accepted, and then expressed, in a very few words,
his thanks for her courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, of course, an object of great interest to
the little group, and did not altogether answer their
expectations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Medway was tall, and rather stout, with a
fine open countenance, yellow and brown, to be sure,
in its hue, but the expression of his mouth contradicted
at once all idea of ill-nature. His eyes were
small, with a keen, shrewd, searching expression;
and one could scarcely credit that their vision was
impaired, so that without glasses he could not distinguish
minute objects. He carried an ear-cornet in
his hand, and apologised for his infirmities, speaking
in a nervous and abrupt manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find me a troublesome inmate, I fear,
madam,” he said to Mrs. Medway; “my infirmities
make me a poor companion. I am a man of few
words, and my loss of hearing renders it almost impossible
to enjoy the conversation of others, while
even the pleasure of reading is in part denied me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughters will be delighted to serve you in
every way,” said Mrs. Medway, graciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now is your chance,” loudly whispered Sophy,
to her sister, “lay your eyes, ears, and tongue, at
the feet of your golden idol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sophy!” exclaimed her mother, in an agony, but
the sight of the ear-cornet calmed her fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening passed slowly away; Uncle Medway
retired early, and the young ladies, after exchanging
opinions of him, went to rest, to dream golden
dreams, as Sophy maliciously said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Medway did not appear at breakfast on the
following morning, but during the forenoon, while
the young ladies were occupied at their several employments,
he unexpectedly entered, and with an
apologetic smile and bow, took the seat which Matilda
hastened to offer, tendering at the same time
very affectionate inquiries regarding his health. The
old gentleman quietly put on his glasses and lowered
his ear-cornet, requesting her to repeat her words,
while Sophy maliciously offered to prompt her, in
case she forgot her lesson. Matilda looked thunder
at her sister, and sunshine at her uncle as she repeated
her questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rested well, thank you,” said her uncle, “and
as I hope to become better acquainted in time, you
will not, I trust, be offended at my scrutiny.” He
took Matilda’s hand as he spoke, and looked earnestly
in her countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you consider me like papa?” she inquired
with her most engaging smile, and speaking in the
cornet, without which it was evident he could hear
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph, not much; your sister there is more like
him,” he answered, pointing with his ear-trumpet to
Sophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Matilda, is ten thousand lost to you,”
laughed the giddy girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does she say?” asked the old gentleman,
casting a shrewd look at her; “come here, merry
one, and tell me yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy rose and courtesied before him, as she said
to Grace, “Your turn next—so prepare. I wonder
if the old Indian thinks he can turn us about as he
would some China ornaments, while we stand bobbing
like so many mandarins before him?” then
turning to her uncle, she added, “I am delighted that
you think I resemble my father, sir, although Matilda
is counted the beauty, and I the fright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Sophy, how can you rattle so,” exclaimed
Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now hush, Grace, until your time comes. You
know I always speak out what I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Especially when you know one party at least
cannot hear,” said her sister, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You all seem to be chattering away among yourselves
like so many magpies,” said the old gentleman.
“But who is this young lady in the corner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our cousin, Grace Addison,” screamed Sophy,
at the top of her voice, “and the dearest, best, kindest
cousin in the world. She makes all our dresses,
copies Matilda’s music, waters her flowers, sketches
in her album, and does a thousand things for which
others get the credit; and more than all, she bears all
my impertinences, and never gets out of patience.
Now, Grace,” turning toward her, “you are properly
introduced, come and speak for yourself. I
think I have made <span class='it'>one party at least</span> hear this time,”
she added, to her sister; “and if old yellow-face has
half as much generosity as he should have, there is a
nice little plum in store for Simple Grace.” So
saying, she ran out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the party met at dinner, there were several
dishes cooked to suit Uncle Medway’s taste, among
the rest a curry. Mrs. Medway and Matilda accepted
some of the proffered viand, but when the
old gentleman politely turned to Sophy, she exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I thank you, none of your nauseous messes
for me—the very smell of them takes away my appetite.
Mamma, after this, I think I shall dine in
my own room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does the young lady say?” asked Uncle
Medway, elevating his cornet, “that she has no appetite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say I can’t bear curry,” screamed Sophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Sophy, how can you be so rude?” said her
mother, in despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I hate hypocrisy,” answered the other,
angrily. “There sits Matilda, striving to appear to
eat what I know she abhors, afraid to say what her
likes or dislikes are; it would not be worth the
effort she makes to swallow it, if the hateful curry-powder
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
was gold-dust. See, she is pale now—and
sick, too, I dare say; for shame, Matilda. Uncle
Medway, must, indeed, be deaf, dumb, and blind, not
to discover in a short time all your false pretences.”
Sophy spoke rapidly, despite of both mother and
sister’s attempts to stop her, and Grace’s appealing
looks. Secure in their guest’s entire deafness, she
railed severely at the deceit she despised. Uncle
Medway cast a searching look toward Matilda, and
then turning to Grace, who sat next him, invited her
to partake of his favorite dish. Grace thanked him,
but declined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” said he, with a smile, “can’t you bear
curry either? Perhaps you have never tasted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not fond of it, I confess,” answered Grace.
“I have often seen it on my grandfather’s table, and
he tried in vain to induce me to like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again those shrewd eyes of Uncle Medway
rested on Grace’s countenance, and no further discussion
arising, the dinner passed pleasantly off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner Grace was left alone with the old
gentleman, while the sisters took their usual promenade,
when suddenly turning toward her, he said,
in his peculiarly abrupt manner, “Who <span class='it'>was</span> your
grandfather?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace looked up in surprise, but immediately answered,
“My grandfather’s name was Maurice
Addison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your father’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jacob Addison; he was born in India—” and
then, with a sudden impulse, she exclaimed, “Oh, Mr.
Medway, did you know my grandfather? Are you
not the old friend I have so often heard him mention,
who went out to India with him, and who was so
true and kind to him in illness and trouble? You
<span class='it'>are</span>, I am sure, and my father was named after you,
Jacob Addison.” It was unusual for the quiet Grace
to be roused to such enthusiasm, but she rose from
her seat, and laying her hand on the old gentleman’s
chair, looked into his face with such an affectionate
and expectant gaze, that his heart must have been
adamant, indeed, to resist it. And as his was, in
reality, a loving and unselfish heart, he drew Grace
gently toward him, and a pleasant smile lighted up
his face, as he said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And <span class='it'>are</span> you Maurice Addison’s own little merry
pet, Grace, he so often mentioned in his letters to
me? <span class='it'>You are</span>, I am sure; and you are the daughter
of my little god-son, Jacob, who was only knee-high
when I saw him last. And now, my dear child, for
surely I have a right to call you so, why are you
living here? Where are your parents?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears started in Grace’s eyes as she related the
circumstances of her parents’ death, and her admission
into Mrs. Medway’s family, adding, that though
they were all very kind to her, she would remain no
longer than until she could procure an independent
situation, as she feared, in Mrs. Medway’s circumstances,
she was a burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” was the only reply; and then the old
gentleman added, “Say nothing about this conversation,
if you please, until I give you permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace willingly acceded; she knew that Mrs.
Medway would not like to believe she possessed any
claim, however slight, on Uncle Medway’s regard;
and although feeling an attachment to him for her
grandfather’s sake, had not the slightest idea of endeavoring
to rival her cousins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Uncle Medway expressed a desire to
drive through the city, and wished one of the ladies
to accompany him as a <span class='it'>cicérone</span>. Matilda’s services
were instantly offered, and politely accepted.
On their return, Matilda threw herself on a sofa, exclaiming
to her mother,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I never was so wearied in all my life; and
I consider this splendid dress, which uncle purchased
for me at Stewart’s, as very hardly earned.
Never will I consent to be driven about, shut up in a
carriage with such a perverse, questioning old
codger again for a dozen dresses. Why the old
man seemed to think I must know the whole history
of the city, from its first settlement—we will have to
lend him <a id='died'></a>Diedrich Knickerbocker’s book. And then
such stopping to admire the churches and other
buildings, while groups of fashionables passed and
stared; it is an ordeal I never will pass through
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The honey-water is exhausted, is it?” asked
Sophy. “You gave it in too great quantities at first;
well, for my part, I might be induced to take one
drive with such a reward in view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that,” asked the uncle, turning sharply
around, “don’t Matilda like her dress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I answer for you?” said Sophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” interrupted Mrs. Medway, “she was
expressing her admiration and gratitude; but she says
she will fear to go with you again, lest you should
think her motives interested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph! the motives are apparent enough!”
muttered the old gentleman; then turning to Grace,
he said, “Will <span class='it'>you</span> accompany me to-morrow,
Grace. I promise faithfully that you shall have no
reward, save the consciousness of obliging a troublesome
old man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grace gladly assented, and Mrs. Medway’s consent
being given, Grace became the almost daily
companion of the old gentleman, who seemed, however,
to bestow but little notice on her, lavishing all
his preference on Matilda, who was elated with her
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after, Uncle Medway brought down a
closely-written letter of several pages, which he
asked Matilda to copy for him, as she had so often
expressed the pleasure it gave her to do any thing
for her dear uncle. Matilda received the document
with a gracious smile, and promised it should be
done by the following morning. That evening the
sisters went out with their mother, and Mr. Medway
retired early to his own room, but having occasion
to come down again for his glasses, he saw Grace
bending over a table, on which were spread writing
materials. She leaned her head on her clasped hands
and sighed heavily. As he entered the room she
looked up, and hastily drew a blank sheet over the
page she had written.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>
“You look pale, child,” said the old gentleman,
as he put on his spectacles. “What are you doing
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only writing a little—but I have a severe headache,”
answered Grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to bed, then—what are you poking your eyes
out there for? I dare say some long letter to a sentimental
friend, eh?” He approached the table as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall not see it, if it is,” said Grace, playfully
putting her hand on the paper, “and I must
finish it to-night, because I have promised—” she
paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said the old man, kindly, “promises
must be kept, of course. I hope Matilda has
kept her promise of copying my letter—do <span class='it'>you</span> think
it will be finished by to-morrow morning, Grace?”
And without waiting a reply, he left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following morning, the letter and copy were
laid by Uncle Medway’s plate, and the old gentleman,
examining it with an approving glance, took a
fifty dollar note from his pocket-book, and said, “I
do not wish to offend, by offering a remuneration
for this correct and beautiful copy; but I know you
ladies have always some charitable object of interest,
and the fair writer of this must have devoted many
hours to its accomplishment. It will gratify her to
have the power of doing good in every way—a
power which will, perhaps, ere long be unlimited.
Will you accept it, Matilda, as to you it justly belongs,
and be my almoner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matilda’s eyes sparkled; this speech inferred much,
and as she gracefully took the note, she thanked her
uncle, and promised to dispose of it in charitable
donations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast, Uncle Medway was deeply engrossed
in a paper, which he was endeavoring to
decipher, and the sisters were sitting together, when
Sophy said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Matilda, what charitable institution do
you intend to benefit by uncle’s donation; as you
earned the money so honorably, you will, of course,
disburse it with equal honesty and justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matilda colored slightly, but laughed, saying, “I
shall do myself the charity to purchase that superb
head-dress, and several costly et cæteras that I want
for Mrs. Dayton’s ball; and if you are a good girl,
and hold your tongue, you shall be an object of
charity, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Matilda, that is too mean, even for you,”
exclaimed the other, indignantly. “Shame on you,
as Grace really copied the letter, she should at least
have the privilege of distributing the money; here
she comes now. Grace, in what way ought uncle’s
donation to be applied—you are the proper person to
decide, and prevent Matilda from the selfishness
she contemplates, in bestowing it all upon herself
and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sister crimsoned with anger, but Grace spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure you do Matilda injustice, Sophy; she
would never act so deliberate a falsehood; as she told
her uncle it should be applied to charity, she will
certainly keep her word. And there is poor Mrs.
Brown, the laundress, it would, indeed, be a charity
to assist her—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And begin by paying her bills,” interrupted
Sophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But her sister, rising angrily, exclaimed, “I will
not <a id='bebe'></a>be dictated to by either of you,” and hastily
left the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Medway had now been domesticated in the
family for several weeks, and must, indeed, have
been deaf, dumb and blind, to remain ignorant of the
by-play going on around him. Secure in his entire
deafness, Matilda frequently made use of her safety-valve
aside; and once, when requested by her uncle
to play, and she said to her sister, “I hope to have
the pleasure of playing the Dead March for him ere
long,” she caught his eye fixed upon her with such a
severe glance, that a momentary doubt of his inability
to hear made her tremble; but again assured by his
bland manner toward her, she plied her fulsome
flatteries more assiduously than ever. Grace often
wondered how one so clear-headed in all other things,
should be so easily imposed upon, while Sophy regarded
her sister with undisguised contempt; and
by way of offset, became more rude and impertinent
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rich uncle had been a great assistance to
the household; his generous heart was continually
prompting him to make those presents which he
saw were required—and this was done in the most
delicate manner. It was with mingled feelings,
therefore, that Mrs. Medway met the information he
one day gave, that he had purchased a house in one
of the most fashionable squares, and desired the taste
of the ladies to assist him in furnishing it. He intended
to celebrate his installation in his own home,
by a splendid ball and supper, to which, as he had
few acquaintances, he begged the ladies to invite
those friends whose society was desirable. He also
told Mrs. Medway, in confidence, that if she would
part with one of her fair charges, he wished on the
appointed evening, publicly to announce his choice
of one of them as his heiress and adopted daughter,
on condition that she resided with him to cheer his
lonely old age. Mrs. Medway gave a delighted
assent. She had no doubt on whom the choice
would fall, and immediately congratulated Matilda,
and caused it to be whispered among her confidential
friends that her eldest daughter would be the heiress
of the Indian nabob. Matilda declared the infliction
of residing with such a horrid bore a severe penalty,
but promised herself the satisfaction of spending his
money at pleasure, while Sophy maliciously advised
her to practice the “Groves of Blarney” preparatory
to the “Dead March.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The important evening arrived, and the three
young ladies, elegantly attired in dresses of embroidered
crape over India satin, presented by Uncle
Medway, took their places in his splendid saloon to
receive their guests. Matilda evidently took the
precedence; and very handsome she looked in her
stately beauty, doing the honors with all the grace
which the future mistress of so superb an establishment
should possess. While Grace, looking perfectly
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span>
lovely in her pure and tasteful dress, shrunk
abashed from the admiring gaze bestowed upon her,
and was confused by the attention she excited.
Uncle Medway went cheerfully among his guests,
ear-cornet in hand, and spectacles on nose, quizzed
by some, respected by many, and flattered by all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as supper was announced, and the musicians
had left the ball for the supper-room, Uncle Medway,
supporting Mrs. Medway on his arm, and followed
by the young ladies, stepped into the midst of the
brilliant circle, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My guests are aware, I suppose, of my intention
to adopt one of these fair young ladies as my sole
heiress, my sister-in-law having kindly consented to
spare one from her bright circle. I am a lonely old
man, with many peculiar notions, and I require,
therefore, a cheerful, yet gentle and patient spirit, to
support my whims. Such an one I have found in the
person of Grace Addison, the grandchild of my oldest
friend, and the daughter of my namesake and godson.
I therefore declare her my adopted child and heiress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A murmur of surprise ran through the assembly,
Mrs. Medway and Matilda seemed ready to sink
with confusion, Sophy clapped her hands, and Grace,
pale and trembling with surprise and emotion, suffered
herself to be led forward by the old gentleman,
who continued,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have met with much kindness and attention
beneath the roof of my sister-in-law, in token of
which I shall bequeath to my niece, Matilda, the sum
of thirty thousand dollars, when she has the pleasure
of playing the Dead March for me. And to her
sister, whose opinions were at least frankly avowed,
I shall leave a similar amount. My ear-cornet and
glasses have served me a trusty part, and I now lay
them aside, I hope forever, trusting that the ladies
have profited by the lesson they have themselves
taught me, that appearances are often deceitful, and
one need not be deaf, dumb and blind, though he is a
Nabob Uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether Mrs. Medway and her daughters stayed
to the splendid supper prepared, and swallowed
their mortification and the delicacies together, this
record sayeth not; but that the beautiful heiress,
Grace Addison, became at once a star of the first
magnitude in the fashionable world, is to be expected;
but the bright star ever found her happiness in enlivening
the home of the eccentric but kind old man,
who found in his adopted daughter the delight and
solace of his old age.</p>

<p class='line'>And flung o’er Nature’s form a sable shroud.</p>
<p class='line'>With step as light as joy the day had gone,</p>
<p class='line'>And sunk into his jeweled couch, o’erhung</p>
<p class='line'>With crimson canopy and crystal sheen.</p>
<p class='line'>The rosy-colored clouds, with emerald fringed,</p>
<p class='line'>That veiled the blushing sky, had faded far—</p>
<p class='line'>And as the night crept on with noiseless tread,</p>
<p class='line'>Bright starry eyes looked on the sleeping Earth,</p>
<p class='line'>And smiled that then it was so like their home.</p>
<p class='line'>Through latticed bower and tesselated hall,</p>
<p class='line'>The zephyr danced with wild and airy wing;</p>
<p class='line'>And spirit-songs sighed on the startled air</p>
<p class='line'>That blew as fragrant as in Araby!</p>

<p class='line'>The Painter turned and saw its thousand fires.</p>
<p class='line'>Around his peaceful form the breezes stole</p>
<p class='line'>With viewless pinions from Æolus sent,</p>
<p class='line'>While ever and anon a passing breath,</p>
<p class='line'>More eager than its fellow, rippled up</p>
<p class='line'>The curls that gathered on his glorious brow.</p>
<p class='line'>Like one whose spirit-form was not of Earth</p>
<p class='line'>He seemed that hour, for o’er him halos hung,</p>
<p class='line'>Such only as the vales of Paradise</p>
<p class='line'>Enclose around the beings of their birth.</p>
<p class='line'>And as he gazed upon the star-lit hall,</p>
<p class='line'>And then with straining sight looked on the sky,</p>
<p class='line'>As if to catch from it some angel glance,</p>
<p class='line'>He sat him down and buried up his face.</p>
<p class='line'>With agony oppressed, his very heart</p>
<p class='line'>Was shrunk and withered, e’en as when a bird</p>
<p class='line'>Whose little life has been a holyday,</p>
<p class='line'>Is overwhelmed as summer clouds have wept.</p>
<p class='line'>Why thus did shadows press upon his soul,</p>
<p class='line'>And with their awful wings fright hopes away?</p>
<p class='line'>Why thus disturbed? Fame in his way had strewn</p>
<p class='line'>With reckless hand, her fairest, proudest gifts—</p>
<p class='line'>Had taught his name to echo far amid</p>
<p class='line'>The ages yet unborn, as though a God</p>
<p class='line'>From high Olympus he’d been missioned forth!</p>
<p class='line'>And yet his heart was sad—for in his dreams</p>
<p class='line'>There broke upon his fancy such a form</p>
<p class='line'>As dwelleth only in the Elfin-land.</p>
<p class='line'>For her he pined—for her he breathed a sigh—</p>
<p class='line'>And prayed to God that she might come to him,</p>
<p class='line'>And in his waking moments bid him live.</p>
<p class='line'>And as, with gloom and darkness thick’ning round,</p>
<p class='line'>He sat and wept for joys that might not be,</p>
<p class='line'>From out the dim and mystic land of dreams,</p>
<p class='line'>There came to him entranced such visioned sights</p>
<p class='line'>As never mortal eye had seen before.</p>
<p class='line'>Back on the crumbling path of Time he went,</p>
<p class='line'>And stood amid the light of ancient days—</p>
<p class='line'>Amidst the treasures of the mighty dead!</p>
<p class='line'>The seal that held the past was shriveled up,</p>
<p class='line'>And from the breathing ruins wondrous forms</p>
<p class='line'>Swept by, and walked again the sea of Life.</p>
<p class='line'>The young and beautiful of olden time—</p>
<p class='line'>The giant habitants whose genius swayed</p>
<p class='line'>The visible creation at its dawn,</p>
<p class='line'>All gathered there in that fantastic realm,</p>

<p class='line'>And as they came,</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span></p>
<p class='line'>One form arose so matchless in its grace,</p>
<p class='line'>That all, amazed, shrank tremblingly away.</p>
<p class='line'>With queenly step she trod the ravished turf,</p>
<p class='line'>And with her winsome foot the lovely buds</p>
<p class='line'>In very ecstasy of rapture played,</p>
<p class='line'>That one so gentle sought their perfumed home.</p>
<p class='line'>A veil of silver-tissue, mottled o’er</p>
<p class='line'>With sparkling stars, hung round her sylphid form,</p>
<p class='line'>And tresses, rich like Autumn’s golden grain,</p>
<p class='line'>Fell down, and nestled on her snowy breast.</p>
<p class='line'>Too exquisite for earth—of mould too fine—</p>
<p class='line'>She seemed a herald from the beaming sky,</p>
<p class='line'>Sent down to whisper of the spirit-land.</p>
<p class='line'>Such sight, I ween, had painter never seen;</p>
<p class='line'>And e’en the charméd breath of poesy,</p>
<p class='line'>Whose blissful cadences the enwrapt ear</p>
<p class='line'>Of wondering mortals caught with silent joy,</p>
<p class='line'>Had conjured up in wild and weird-like spell,</p>
<p class='line'>No face that ever was so fair and bright.</p>
<p class='line'>One look she gave the painter as he gazed,</p>
<p class='line'>That made to him a desert of the world—</p>
<p class='line'>A look so full of passion and of love,</p>
<p class='line'>It turned the memory of the past a blank,</p>
<p class='line'>And in the future left him naught but her.</p>
<p class='line'>His soul was all afire, and his brain</p>
<p class='line'>Swam round, as when the throbbing heart of man</p>
<p class='line'>Is burst for happiness it cannot hold;</p>
<p class='line'>And as he strove to break the mortal chain</p>
<p class='line'>That bound him where he lay, a mist arose</p>
<p class='line'>And envious bore that being from the spot.</p>
<p class='line'>Far from his sight she fled! and passed away</p>
<p class='line'>With floating witcheries of wildest song,</p>
<p class='line'>Into the twilight land where spirit forms</p>
<p class='line'>Like phantoms mingled with the swelling gale.</p>
<p class='line'>Far from his sight she fled! and like a <a id='barq'></a>barque</p>
<p class='line'>Whose guiding star has left its native sky,</p>
<p class='line'>The painter drifted on with heedless sail!</p>
<p class='line'><span class='bold'> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p class='line'>The morning breeze crept in the painter’s hall!</p>
<p class='line'>And near the window ledge, with pallid brow,</p>
<p class='line'>He lay like one whose very pulse had gone.</p>
<p class='line'>With tips of gold the princely spires and domes</p>
<p class='line'>Of Florence gleamed, and on her throne she sat</p>
<p class='line'>A queen in pride—queen of the Tuscan land!</p>
<p class='line'>The morning grew apace, and fleecy clouds,</p>
<p class='line'>The children of the dawn, trailed o’er the sky.</p>
<p class='line'>Still Raffaelle slept.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Near by his side</p>
<p class='line'>Were rudely strewn the handmaids of his toil;</p>
<p class='line'>And on his easel hung a picture full</p>
<p class='line'>Of beauty as the glow on Dian’s front.</p>
<p class='line'>No human eye had ever turned its gaze</p>
<p class='line'>Upon that fair and sacred thing, save one,</p>
<p class='line'>And little recked he now of bliss in store.</p>
<p class='line'>The morning breeze crept in the painter’s hall,</p>
<p class='line'>And catching its fresh scent he woke and stared</p>
<p class='line'>Upon the sky that blazed with living light;</p>
<p class='line'>And then again around the hall he cast</p>
<p class='line'>A look that spoke of sorrow and of pain.</p>
<p class='line'>And while he tried to chase away the clouds</p>
<p class='line'>That brooded o’er him like a fearful spell,</p>
<p class='line'>The radiant image of that lovely one</p>
<p class='line'>That was his nightly dream, flashed on his sight;</p>
<p class='line'>With wonderment he stood and scarcely breathed,</p>
<p class='line'>For fear a lightsome sound might fright her far.</p>
<p class='line'>Ay! there she beamed—a rainbow in the storm—</p>
<p class='line'>For in his sleep his mighty genius woke,</p>
<p class='line'>And gave <a id='embod'></a>embodiment to face and form;</p>
<p class='line'>And joy clung round his overburdened heart,</p>
<p class='line'>Like sunlight on the drooping bud, when storms</p>
<p class='line'>Have rocked its tender petals in the breeze!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY M. S. G. NICHOLS, AUTHOR OF “UNCLE JOHN,” “THE WORLD AS IT IS,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_7'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A pale, wan woman, with a young girl by her
side, walked quickly along Chatham street, just as
the twilight was deepening into darkness. She was
very thinly clad, her light shawl was only a covering—it
was no protection from the keen autumn air. It
had once been an elegant and fashionable silk, but
its fashion had long since passed away. It had been
colored and colored again, until its substance had
well-nigh disappeared. Her straw bonnet had been
renovated many times, but not for a long time, and
its faded ribbon was passed plainly over the crown,
for it would have been mockery to make such ribbon
into bows. Every thing that covered this young
creature was passing away, and as she entered a
pawn-broker’s shop, you might have seen by the
light of the lamp that fell on her face, that she, too,
was passing from a world that had given her small
welcome, at least for many years. It would have
been a comfort to any benevolent person, who had
looked into that pale face, to have seen the red spot
on one of her cheeks, and to have heard her cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had she to do in a world so cold, with that
miserable shawl to wrap around her ulcerated lungs,
that smarted like fire with every breath of cold air
they inhaled. She might as well have wrapped herself
in cobwebs, as in clothes such as hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went into the shop, her poor, little, shadowy
child clung close to her mother. She had little
knowledge of the place or the people, though she had
many times been there, but she knew that after many
tears, her mother went there, and then that for a
brief space they had food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor lady took from her pocket two miniature
pictures—the golden setting had been removed sometime
before. They were by a master’s hand, worth at
least one hundred dollars each, and infinitely precious
to her, being the likenesses of her father and mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you give me for these?” said she,
trembling in every nerve as she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hard money-getting son of Israel, whose trade
was pawn-broking, and whose business made him
look on misery three hundred and thirteen days in
the year, answered, “They are worth nothing to me,
madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady shrunk into herself as if she had been
shriveled. Her face and lips became deadly pale.
She supported herself against the side of the box in
which she stood, to conceal herself from view; and
her little girl held her hand and clung to her garments
in great fear. Very soon she began to cough,
and in a moment her thin, tattered, white handkerchief
was saturated with the blood she raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Jew looked at her with a mingling of kindness
and fear. She must not bleed to death there. The
pictures he knew were of much value, though there
was a good deal of risk in taking them. He pitied
the bleeding woman. Yet, pawn-broker and Jew as
he was, he pitied her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you four dollars on them,” said he,
and he hastily ticketed them, and handed her the
money, to her infinite relief. She felt that she
and her child had now a reprieve from death.
The Jew selected some bills that bore a discount of
ten per cent., and yet he pitied the woman, and she
was so grateful to him that she could have pressed
his hand, and wept hot tears upon it. She hurried
away to her attic in Frankfort street. It was dark,
and she feared insult. New York was worse lighted
and worse cared for then than now. We had no
gas and no star police then, but we had plenty of
Jews and pawn-broker’s shops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she passed along she raised the blood that
pressed into her throat as fast as possible, but still it
almost strangled her. Well-dressed people, men of
business, returning home, and men and women hurrying
to the theatre, the concert-room, or the prayer-meeting,
or to the varied business or amusement of
life, passed her without notice. She was their sister,
but how were they to know that she was dying—that
her scanty life-current was staining the pavement
on which they stepped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reached the last landing-place, and thought
that she could go no further, but it was not seemly
to die there, and she made a last effort and entered
her room. She was startled by a bright light in the
room—light at night she had not had since she made
the last dozen of shirts at ten cents a piece. Stranger
still, there was a good, bright fire in the grate. Her
husband stood before it, with his face toward the door,
and his hands behind him, showily dressed as usual.
She had not seen him for many days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Edward!” said she, “I am so glad you are
come”—and she fainted, and would have fallen to the
floor if he had not caught her in his arms. He laid
her upon the meagre bed that had long since been
robbed of every valuable article for the pawn-broker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fanny,” said he, with a choking voice, “my
poor Fanny!” He sprinkled water on her face, and
she opened her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going, Edward,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no!—you will not die now. O, don’t die
till you have forgiven me for being your mur—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t say that—I forgive as I would be forgiven.
Our child—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hard fit of coughing and copious bleeding hindered
her from speaking for some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our poor Marie—give her to your Cousin Charles;
he has wealth and none to care for. Promise me
that you will do this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The husband, trembling with fear, gave her the
required promise, when she strangled from an excessive
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
rush of blood into the trachea, and died with her
daughter clinging madly around her neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Evans, the gambler and man about town,
was alone with his dead wife, who, fourteen years
before, he had persuaded to elope from her parents,
and to marry him. She had gone through every
gradation of suffering and poverty, and but for a
strange run of luck that he had had for two or three
evenings, she would have died in that dark, cold
room, alone with her child, and have been buried in
Potter’s Field. As it was, Evans had a basket of
coal, a pound of candles, some food, and money to
buy his wife a grave. And wretched as he was, we
must do him the justice to say that he was glad to be
able to bury his wife decently. And he did it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he bethought him of her last request.
He must make the effort to give away the child, who
had clung to the corpse of her mother to the last moment,
and who had not seemed to see or hear at all,
since that mother was buried out of her sight.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_8'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A patient, plodding man was Charles Evans—a man
who had made his own fortune, and was perfectly
sure that every man might do the same who chose
to mind his own business and keep at work, and not
spend money or time. He went to election and
voted, and went home without drinking a “brandy-smasher,”
or a “whiskey-toddy.” He was a democrat
when he had no property to protect, and when he
had acquired wealth, he had got in the habit of being
a democrat—and his democracy was his religion, his
Faith in Human Brotherhood. He immured himself
in a living tomb in Wall street all day, and worked
half the night at his home in William street, beside.
It was here that Edward Evans found him, the
evening after his wife’s funeral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Ned?” said Charles, glancing at
him to see if he were sober, and then continued to
fold and direct letters, seeming a little nervous under
the infliction of a visit from his worthless cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been very unfortunate,” said Ned, a good
deal troubled how to penetrate his thick-skinned
cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew you otherwise,” said Charles, and
he wrote on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, I have had the bad fortune to bury my
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good fortune for her,” said his cousin, but
he dropped his pen and regarded the weed on Ned’s
hat. “I did not notice that you were in mourning.
So Fanny is dead. It is a long time since I have
seen her. She died of a broken-heart, I suppose, you
will allow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She bled to death from her lungs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the same. Pity it had not been you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to see you about the child. She wished
me to give her to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To ME,” said his cousin, starting with real
astonishment. “What could I do with a child, and
a child who could never see her father again if she
were to live with me? How old is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t justly remember,” said Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a race-horse in the city whose age you
don’t remember? How long did it take you to kill
your wife—do you know that? How long have you
been a drunkard and a devil? How long have you
eaten when your wife and child starved? How long
have you hid them where even I could not find
them—can you tell me that, you decently dressed
vagabond? I’ll warrant your wife is clad as warmly
in her grave as she was out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ned could answer nothing. He was a wretch—and
he had the good sense to know it. He had not
the slightest respect for himself, but he wanted his
child taken care of; then, if he had a pint of brandy,
and six feet of rope, he <span class='it'>thought</span> he would comfort
himself with the brandy, and hang himself with the
rope; but then he had a great liking for cards and a
decent rig, and it is probable that while luck, or
loaded dice, gave him broadcloth and brandy, he
would have laid up the rope against a lack of
either, which he would have considered a decided
reverse of fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promised my wife that I would give the girl to
you. If you will take her, I will go to the South,
and never show my face here again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth am I to do with a child? My old
blind aunt can’t see to herself and me—how is she to
take care of another? But it is a temptation to be
rid of you. How does the girl look?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father was again at a loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you don’t know—what color is Kenny’s
horse, Eclipse? How many hands high is he, and
how old? How far can he run in ten minutes and
thirteen seconds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once for all—will you take the girl?” said the
man whose life was exhausted by dissipation and
excitement into an apathy that resembled patience.
“She will have to go to the Almshouse if you don’t,
and your blood is in her veins. She is your grandmother’s
grandchild.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>would</span> like you to be the only one of our blood
who should die in the Almshouse; but I say again—what
am I to do with the child? I can only take her
as a servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make a slave of your own blood if you like,”
replied the father, whose stupid apathy was pierced
at last. “She had better serve you than serve the
devil. She is a good, serviceable child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, you know that, do you? No doubt you know
all about that. Look you, Ned Evans, I owe you no
service. I have earned every dollar I have, whilst
you have squandered a fortune twice as large as mine,
of your own, and another for your wife, whilst you
have been a sponge to soak brandy, a gambler and a
stool-pigeon for gamblers, and have made acquaintance
with every horse-dealer and all the horse-flesh
in the Union, and have murdered your wife by inches,
till at the age of 29 years, an age when she should be
as fresh as a new-blown rose, and with her fortune
living as well as any lady in the land, you have done
her the last and only kindness you ever did her—you
have bought her a pine coffin, and have seen her
buried. But though I know you ought to be hung,
I will make a bargain with you. I will see you on
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
board a vessel bound for New Orleans, with your
passage paid, and take your child. You agree to go
to New Orleans. When once you are there, I have
no fear of you or your ghost ever appearing to me
again. On these conditions I will take the child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When must I sail for New Orleans? I’ll go
after Monday. The race with Eclipse and Black
Bess comes off then. I have agreed to ride for
Kenny. I know the horse better than anybody else.
Besides, a fellow must keep his word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good,” said Charles, after a moment’s
thought. “You <span class='it'>may</span> break your neck, and save me
the passage-money. I agree to that—any thing
more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When may I bring the girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow morning at 6 o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s too early to wake her,” mumbled Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, or not at all. You can keep sober one
night, and get up in decent season one morning in
your life, for the sake of getting your child a situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If a particle of Ned Evans’ old spirit had been left,
this taunt of getting his daughter a situation would
have roused it. But his life was crushed. He was
hopelessly besotted and exhausted, though now he
had decent clothes, for which he had sacrificed the
last remnant of decent feeling he possessed. These
clothes belonged to the keeper of the vilest Hell in
New York; and Ned was his “decoy-duck,” and
did any job the fellow set him about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was as craven before his cousin as possible.
He had one instinct of his nature left—he wanted to
provide for his child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be here at the time, so help me God,” said
he—and he kept his word. It was the last right act
of his life. As if to make his cousin out a prophet,
he rode Eclipse, and broke his neck in earnest,
though not in “<span class='it'>sober</span> earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Charles Evans heard of it, he only said,
“One poor devil less in the world;” but he murmured
to himself, as he turned away, “Poor Cousin
Ned!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_9'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Send the little girl to my room to-night, aunty,
when you have made her decent. I must see what
she is fit for, and what she looks like. Remember,
she is to have good warm clothes, but no gewgawry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At 8 o’clock precisely, Marie came into Mr. Evans’s
room with a waiter, on which was spread the most
frugal sort of a supper. Rye bread and butter and
black tea, it was his sovereign pleasure to be served
with at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Evans had had time only to extemporise an
amelioration in the girl’s dress. She was at that
very awkward age when a girl is not a child or a
woman. She had a heavy burden of deep-red hair,
and all her bones showed through their scant covering
of flesh—and they seemed hung on wires, and
very loosely hung, too. Her eyes were a very deep
blue, but she had been somewhat “cross-eyed” from
infancy, and now the defect was much aggravated
by her constant weeping. She was very timid,
shrinking from every one. What had she ever found
in her lot to assure her or give her confidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor, forlorn, ill-dressed, cross-eyed, red-haired,
little one—all your defects are so many commendations
to Charles Evans. In the deep selfishness of
his benevolence he could love just such a child—one
whom others would only pity and never think of
loving. And he felt a sort of secure property in her
when he saw that no one else would be likely to care
for her; but he would be very certain not to let her
know that he had any kind feelings for her. He was
a scraggy limb of the law, and one would think that
all the sap of his life had been written out in deeds
and documents that brought him dollars, and that all
the warmth of his heart had been expended on the
Loco Foco candidates from his ward, district, city,
county, etc., etc., during the time he had been a
legal voter, which had now reached the term of fourteen
years. He had amassed a large property, and
had neither “chick nor child” to leave it to, as his
friends said, all and singular of said friends having
made up their minds that he would never marry,
though he had only reached the mature and well-judging
age of thirty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He liked to be thought well of, as who does not;
and there was a delicate flattery to him in the thought
that Fanny Evans trusted her child to <span class='it'>him</span> before
any of her own or her husband’s relatives. To any
one of these relatives he would have spoken of the
burden of bringing up other folks’ brats, but in his
heart he thought “it was very wise, and well-judged,
and kind of Fanny, to leave the girl to me; and when
Ned is out of the way, I shall have nothing to interfere
with my plans for the child’s welfare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Marie had set his waiter upon the table, she
stopped and timidly raised her cross-eyes to Mr.
Evans, to see if he wanted any thing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Marie,” said he. “I wish your name
was Fanny, I don’t like fancy names and flummery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was named for my mother, Frances Maria,”
said she, in the sweetest and softest voice that Evans
remembered ever to have heard. Her voice penetrated
his heart—and then her name was Fanny. He
had always cherished a cordial friendship and a true
respect for her mother—and he wished the girl to
bear her mother’s name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like very much to be called Fanny,”
said the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, Fanny, how do you like your new
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very glad of it,” said Fanny, and the tears
filled her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t cry—there’s a good girl. Do you wish
to go to school?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how I would like school. My dear
mother always taught me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you must go and see how you will get on.
You will be a good girl, I dare say. You will obey
Mrs. Evans in all she asks of you. If you want any
thing, come to me. You will call me Cousin Charles
when you speak to me, and Mr. Evans when you
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
speak of me. When you speak to Mrs. E. call her
aunty, and Mrs. Evans when you speak of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus little Fanny began her life at her cousin’s
comfortable home. When she was told of her
father’s death, she shuddered and felt relieved. Fanny
loved her mother as we always love when we have
few objects for our affections to rest on. But with
the blessed faith of a child and a Christian, she believed
she was now in heaven, where she would be
perfectly happy forever, and she became strangely
happy in her new home. All her studies and occupations
were so many changing joys. From morning
till night she was like some bright bird that knew
not where to bestow the fullness of its brilliant and
merry carolings. Everybody saw as the months
passed away, how she wound herself around the
heart of Charles Evans; and the friends began to prophesy
that he would adopt her as his child, and make
her his heir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Evans was a woman of great goodness, very
old, and very pious. She had now but one wish
ungratified, and that was that Charles Evans and his
ward should be converted. This seemed a hard
matter to accomplish as far as Evans was concerned.
He was rather a hopeless subject, for he boasted that
he was a temperance man, that he never drank any
thing stronger than black tea, that he never chewed
tobacco, took laughing gas, or went to a protracted
meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to church with aunty enough to keep the
peace,” said he to Fanny. “You and I will not
quarrel about it as long as it tends to aunty’s comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not like you to quarrel with me if I
went for my own comfort,” said Fanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This touch of his own independence pleased him,
and he said, “Go along, you gipsy—thistles and
lilies never quarrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red-haired girls are never lilies, though cross
cousins are very sharp thistles,” said Fanny, who, a
year ago, would as soon have indulged in repartee
with her cousin as the lily he likened her to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have grown very bold, if not very handsome,”
he replied—and Fanny went to church with
her aunt. She was never disturbed there, however
much good Mrs. Evans prayed for such result.
Some of her prayers had been answered. She had
prayed for many years that all the theatres might be
converted into chapels, and at last <span class='it'>one</span> of them was,
and she had the pleasure of hearing the divine Mr.
Kirchard preach in it, from Sunday to Sunday, and
various week days and evenings beside. He was an
earnest preacher, and it was surprising the quantities
of green tea, cayenne and cavendish that he converted
into gospel. The ladies of his church presented
the pulpit with an elegant cushion and spittoon,
and never mortal minister had more use for
both than the Rev. Mr. Kirchard. The way he beat
the cushion and filled the other article, when he
alarmed the sinners, <span class='it'>was</span> plentiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Fanny was never disturbed with the powerful
preaching of the reverend gentleman. Like a man
who tends a saw-mill half the time, and sleeps soundly
when relieved by his companion who tends it the
other half, so Fanny was always very peaceful in
church, if she was not sleepy. I believe she had a
conscience against sleeping, though what she kept
awake for, perhaps she was not herself aware. But
it was very exemplary of her, and very gratifying
to good Mrs. Evans.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_10'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There are some good people who deny the doctrine
of total depravity, who don’t see how it is possible
for a man deliberately to be a hypocrite. They
say that a man can’t live unless he has some good
in him. I shall not dispute with these worthy people,
because, in a free country, every man has a right to
his own opinion, provided he does not happen to
think that he may buy tickets in lotteries out of Wall
street, and appropriate his neighbor’s goods without
the formalities made and provided in the righteous
common law of our social code; but I must say that
if goodness is necessary to keep people alive, some
folks have the gift of living on “small means;” and
it becomes my duty to introduce a young gentleman
eminently gifted in this particular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sylvester Wilson was a young man who had a
laudable wish for his own advancement, but, unfortunately
for his piety, he was entirely indifferent to
the means that contributed to his getting ahead, provided
the world made no complaint of him. The
opinion of those about him, with two-thirds the facts
concealed from them, was a moral law for him, and
he had no other. His father was a bad, ambitious
and unscrupulous man, and the hereditary transmission
of qualities would have charmed Fowler,
though the qualities proved that he was “bad, born
bad, and had no business here” but to make mischief.
He was, however, an excellent dissembler,
and passed for a pious and exemplary young man,
punctual at church, and designed for the ministry.
His family were friends of the Evans family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, mother, have you wormed any thing out
of old Aunty Evans about that red-haired horror’s
adoption?” said Sylvester Wilson, to his mother one
day, when she had been taking an old-fashioned cup
of tea with Mrs. Evans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How <span class='it'>can</span> you, Sylvester!” said his mother, a
good deal disturbed. “The child is very well, I
am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frights generally have good health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant that she was very well-looking. She
has changed much in the two years she has lived
with her cousin. Her hair is deepening its color,
her eyes do not squint any more, and she is very
plump and fresh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the better for me—fourteen, is she? She
will get better still, perhaps, in two or three years.
But about the cash, mother—will that old hunks of a
cousin portion her? If so, I am his man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Evans thinks he considers her as good as
his own child now,” said Mrs. Wilson. “You are
to be three years in the University, my child, and
you can’t think of a wife till that time is past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what harm <span class='it'>thinking</span> is to do a
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
fellow. I am not in the University yet, and I don’t
exactly see how I am to be there, unless I find a
gold mine. If I could get employed to give lessons
to that fox-pate, I might earn some money, and
borrow more, and get an education and independence
at last. One can’t expect beauty and tin together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Success was all Mrs. Wilson asked for her son,
and his life-plans did not seem to her at all profane.
And he succeeded in obtaining the place he sought.
He gave Fanny lessons in music and mathematics.
It was a great triumph when Fanny got leave of
Cousin Charles to learn music. She had thought of
a piano, and dreamed of one, and thumped on one
that belonged to a young friend for a long time—but
she had no idea of ever being the happy possessor of
a mine of music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Christmas, just about two years from the time
when she came to live with her cousin, she made a
little “Christmas box” for her best friend. It contained
a pair of slippers, a watch-holder, and a lamp-mat,
all worked by herself. They had grown very
pretty under her skillful fingers, but the coarse
canvas had not changed more under her hands than
she had changed since she had lived in this happy
home. And she was daily improving. When Charles
Evans found this Christmas gift on his table, he resolved
to give Fanny just what she should ask for,
and so he said, “I have only got you a book for
Christmas, Fanny, but if you think of any thing else
that you want, you must tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you really give it me?” said Fanny,
and her deep-blue eyes seemed melting in their own
lustre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I will, because I have said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, dear, good Cousin Charles, buy me
a piano.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy you a winter full of thunder storms—why
you will bang me deaf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not dumb, I’ll bet any thing—you will always
be able to scold your poor Cousin Fanny. But I
shall play when you are away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather think you will when you get a piano.
Why do you know what a deal of money one of
those thunderers costs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny began to be frightened. She did not know,
but she was really like the child who cried for the
moon. The tears came into her eyes as she thought
of herself two years ago. She looked up at her
cousin, with her grateful soul beaming from her
beautiful eyes, and smiling through her tears, she
said, “Cousin, I was very wrong to ask such an impossible
thing—will you buy me a canary-bird?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you give up all claim to the piano if I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, yes, to be sure. Please to forget it. Indeed,
I did not mean to be a silly girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended the talk of the piano; but the next
afternoon an elegant piano and a beautiful canary-bird,
were domesticated in Mr. Evans’s quiet parlor—and
Fanny was perfectly wild with delight. That
was a wonderful era in her life—a time to date from
forever after—though Cousin Charles brushed her
off as if she had been a whole swarm of black flies,
when she ran to his room, on his return in the evening,
to overwhelm him with thanks, and tears, and crazy
rejoicings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, Fanny,” said he, “you had better
make up your mind whether you are going to melt,
or fly away, or go to a lunatic asylum; and when
you have concluded, just come and let me know,
will you? I can do without you till then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next thing to the piano must be a music-teacher.
Young Wilson had played his cards skillfully.
He had interested Charles Evans in his fortunes,
and he engaged him from motives of benevolence,
to teach Fanny. To do him justice, he was
a good teacher. But Evans was cheated. He did
not think it possible that the fellow could have
thought but to teach Fanny, that he might mend his
small means—a most praiseworthy object in the
young man, and one that Evans felt anxious to assist
him in attaining. Though Fanny had grown very
pretty, and was daily improving, yet her cousin was
hardly conscious of it. He thought of her as a mere
child as she was, and a very ugly child as she had
been; and it never once entered his mind that any
young man could have designs upon the heart of
the little one. Young Wilson interested him, not
because he knew him, but because he did not know
him. He saw him struggling to get an education,
and pay for it himself, and he was glad to have an
excuse to offer him assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evans had small love for music, but mathematics
was a pet of the first magnitude with him, and for
the sake of this branch of study, he compromised
and gave the girl her music. So he said; but the
truth was, he wished Fanny to be happy. And he
had his wish. The bird and the piano were all the
time new, and she could never for a moment, asleep
or awake, cease to rejoice in either. She kept her
word not to play when Mr. Evans was at home.
But then this was no great privation, for the bird
sang like mad all the morning, and he went away
early, and she managed to tire herself so thoroughly
during the day, that she was very willing to go
patiently and quietly into figures for the evening.
Mr. Evans was quite satisfied, for as he said he saw
Fanny always at her “sums,” and never was disturbed
by drums or thunder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilson found himself of just as much social importance
to Fanny as a piano or an algebra. She
would have been just as much interested in a calculating
machine; and if her piano could have taught
her to play on it, she would have been neither better
or worse pleased than now. To be sure she was glad
when her Aunt Evans told her of the struggles of
young Wilson to educate himself that she had him
for a teacher, but she never thought enough of him
to mention him to Mr. Evans; first, because she
seldom needed his help in her mathematical studies,
and of music she never spoke to her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilson was prudent and careful. He had good
hope of getting into the University—in time of a
pulpit, and a rich wife. No word, or look, or overt
act ever revealed to Fanny or her friends, that he
had designs on the fortune of Mr. Evans, through a
marriage with his ward. For months he labored
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
<a id='assi'></a>assiduously, when an accident occurred that changed
the face of his fortune, though, perhaps, it did not
materially affect Fanny. A merchant uncle of Wilson,
who lived at New Orleans, found himself in need of
an assistant, in consequence of failing health. He
was a man of wealth, and Wilson considered his
fortune assured by this chance—and so the church
lost the chance of adding to her ornaments another
of those paste gems that bring the real jewels into
disrepute.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_11'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Seventeen! sweet, gay, laughing seventeen had
come to Fanny—and she had never once thought of
getting married. Not she. She would have been
obliged to contemplate marriage as something that
must separate her from the only home she had ever
known; and she would as soon have stepped out of
her skin some cold night, as have gone away from
her dear friends. She liked everybody and loved
nobody, and wanted to hug the whole world, as she
forcibly said, because she was so happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christmas Eve, to-morrow, Cousin Charles; I
hope all my presents are purchased and directed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what are you going to give <span class='it'>me</span>, little Miss
Fairy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Myself, to be sure,” laughed Fanny. “What
else have I to give away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that you wont. You will keep yourself for
some worthless fellow, I’ll warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I thank you. I had rather be excused. I
intend to make your black tea as long as you live, if
you don’t conclude to leave the tea out, and take
water with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, you will marry a scamp the day after you
are eighteen—that is the way with all the women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be a prodigious number of scamps,
then, cousin; and if you had only been one of them,
you might have been <span class='it'>happily married</span>, instead of
being the nicest bear of a bachelor at large.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I might get married even now, if I were
only fool enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as you are very wise, you shall be my
Cousin Charles, and nothing else—and I would not
exchange you for a pet porcupine. Don’t you see
how I prize you? So don’t think of getting married—I
should quarrel with your wife, to see which
should love you best; and that would be very inconvenient
for us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas was a merry time at Charles Evans’s.
The man of deeds and documents always relaxed
and came out of the world of business, or, as he said,
“allowed the world to mind its own business” at
Christmas and New Year. But something very
serious happened to Mr. Evans from this year’s
Christmas merry-making. A pretty girl needed some
one to see her home, and glowing and perspiring
from the last game at “Blind Man’s Buff,” Mr.
Evans attended her on a bitter night, which made
him run home as rapidly as possible, with chattering
teeth, and a chill that seemed to go quite to his heart.
Next morning he awoke with a quaking headache
and pains through all his bones, and great heat and
cold chills, and all the concomitants of a bad fever
about him. Thanks to the exhaustion of unremitting
and most unreasonable labor, such as a great many
men perform who do the head-work for the headless
multitude, and thanks also to the lancet of a certain
doctor, who held to letting the bad blood out of a
man, and poisoning what remained to purify it, Mr.
Evans became dangerously sick. What an invaluable
treasure was Fanny now. Her foot was the lightest—her
hand was the softest and coolest—her eyes
never closed in slumber, unless she left the best of
watchers in her place—and she threw quantities of
physic to the dogs, or some equally prudent place,
and she nourished the patient carefully when he
began to get well; and at last, in spite of all the evils
in the patient, and out of him, doctors and drugs included,
she saw Mr. Evans convalescent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length he came down stairs, and when he
thought how long Fanny had left her piano locked,
and not even listened to her canary, he asked her
for a song. It was in very kindness to her, and in
accordance with his benevolent character—for he
thought that he disliked music, and it is probable that
he had the good taste to dislike the heathen discord
that had been christened music, where he had happened
to be the victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Battle of Prague, thumped with indenting
emphasis on a piano sadly out of tune, had given
Mr. Evans his ideas of melody; and it is small
wonder that he had as great dislike for music as prudent
regard for his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a great surprise to Mr. Evans when Fanny’s
melodious voice fell on his ear, appropriately accompanied
by the instrument, which was one of the
softest and sweetest in the world. He had expected
the Battle of Prague, and it seemed to him, so great
was the contrast, like humming-birds amid the
flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny sung a song of her own composing, descriptive
of her own life, first in its great sadness
and trials and deep grief with her sainted mother,
and then her bereavement, and then her adoption by
her cousin, and the calm flow of her life since then.
At the close of her song she alluded to her best
friend’s illness, and spoke of her joy that he was
now safely recovering. The song and the music
were her own, and they came from the depth of her
heart. The sad, sweet murmur of her soul’s sorrow
in the first verses, was succeeded by the calm
happiness and bird-like joy of the years passed in her
cousin’s home, and again the sorrowful notes spoke
of his illness, and the winged joy burst forth in the
happy conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a triumph to Fanny when she saw at the
close of the piece tears rolling over Mr. Evans’s
face, and he said, with a voice rendered indistinct
by emotion, “Sing it again, Fanny”—and she was
only too happy to comply with his request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the song was ended, he conquered his emotion,
and laughing through his tears, he said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall be my nightingale, Fanny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I accept the appointment—what
salary do you intend to give?” said Fanny, as she
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
sat down on the sofa by the invalid, and passed her
hand over his high, white forehead, to see if any
fever were warning her to send her patient away
to rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you myself and all that I have,” said
he, again bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flood of new thoughts rushed through the mind
of Fanny. She paused to think what to say. “You
are weak, cousin, and must not sit up too long.
Will you go to your room, or will you rest and sleep
on the sofa here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Evans was frightened at what he had said.
He was sure Fanny could never love him only as a
father or elder brother; and now he thought he had
broken the freedom of that relation, and he blamed
himself, and troubled himself, and well-nigh fretted
himself into a relapse of his fever. But his naturally
strong constitution triumphed, and in a few weeks
he was perfectly restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Fanny had become grave and thoughtful;
and, truth to tell, she shunned her cousin more
than she ought. She had not known how dear he
was to her till his illness—during the time that he
was considered dangerous she had neither eaten nor
slept. She had watched over him as a mother
watches her first born. She felt that if he should die,
life, which had always seemed so full of joy and
blessing, would be a blank to her. She had not
asked herself if this were love. She had supposed
it was only the interest she ought to feel in her cousin.
Now she was put upon examining her own heart.
She fully believed that her cousin was by no means
in love with her, but that his tender confession was
owing to the weakness induced by his severe illness
and his gratitude to his fortunately successful nurse.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_12'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, mother, tell me all about the Evanses.
Is my flame as foxy as ever? She must be quite a
young lady. Heaven forgive me for not being
thankful enough for all mercies in general, and for
the particular one that I am not obliged to marry red
hair.” Thus spoke the fortunate Wilson, the morning
after his arrival from New Orleans, bringing the
welcome news that his relative was dead, and that
he was his heir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too hasty, Sylvester,” said his mother.
“Miss Evans has changed more than any one you
ever saw. She is a perfect beauty, bating her freckles.
Her hair is no more red than a chestnut. She is
plump and round as an apple; she is white as snow,
and her eyes are as pretty as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen, mother! One would think you were her
lover instead of your hopeful son. But I will see
for myself. I shall not take your word or your bond
for that girl’s beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so Mr. Wilson, armed for conquest, presented
himself before Miss Evans. She had never cared
enough for him to be very glad to see him, but she
received him politely and kindly, as was her nature.
He was a very good-looking, stylish young man, and
he talked well on common topics, and soon succeeded
in interesting Fanny. He was quite unprepared, notwithstanding
all his mother had said, for the beauty
that had grown upon Fanny. He loved beauty just
as he loved roast pig and canvas-backs—and he was
smashed at once—Fanny had made an impression.
He asked her to play and sing for her <span class='it'>cidevant</span>
teacher, and the impression was fixed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilson was sure at the end of an hour that he
should marry Fanny Evans; and Fanny thought
him a very good-looking, interesting young man,
and she rejoiced in his good fortune; their musical
tastes formed a bond between them, and it
soon seemed very natural and proper to Fanny that
she saw young Wilson daily. She was sad, and
singing diverted her. His voice was good, and they
sung duets. He played finely, and this was very
pleasant. She had become estranged from her cousin,
and she wanted some company. Fanny had never
been so unhappy since she first came to live with
her cousin. Finally, Wilson offered himself to her.
This was an event to Fanny entirely unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak of such a thing,” said she, earnestly.
“Pray excuse me, Mr. Wilson,” and she went
straight out of the room. When she reached her
chamber, she felt very sorrowful, and, truth to tell,
very sick. She had been worn down by labor and
watching during Mr. Evans’s illness, and her sadness
in being estranged from him. She had got
nervous, and began, for the first time in her life, to
have the <span class='it'>blues</span>. She almost persuaded herself that
she was become a burden to her cousin, and that she
ought to marry Wilson. She wept till she had a
dreadful headache, and when the servant came to
call her to make Mr. Evans’s tea, she was really too
ill to go down—and with swollen eyes, red face, and
dabbled and disarranged curls, she looked into the
glass, and dared not present herself before her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Mr. Evans that I have a bad headache, and
if he will excuse me, I will go early to bed. Make
every thing very nice for him, Norah. Were his
slippers warm when he came in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, Miss, but I will get his supper
good”—and she went to carry Fanny’s excuse to Mr.
Evans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back, Norah, quickly, and ask Miss Evans
if I may come up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny had wheeled her sofa to the fire, and had
just buried her face in a velvet cushion to weep as
long and as much as she wished. Mr. Evans, in his
concern for her, had followed Norah, and stood outside
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him not to trouble himself to come up. I
shall do very well as soon as I have slept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had asked me to take the trouble to stay
down stairs, I might have thought of it; but seeing I
am here, it is no trouble to come; and you are so
bright and cosy, suppose you let the girl bring the
waiter up here and make my tea for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Evans was quite sure that something beside
sickness had happened to Fanny, and he intended to
be confessor or doctor, as the case might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norah, bring Mr. Evans’s supper to my room,”
said Fanny, more cheerfully than she would have
thought possible a few minutes before. And she
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
passed into her bed-room and bathed her face and her
eyes, and arranged her hair, and came back to make
tea for Mr. Evans very much improved. But she
could not talk—she had fairly lost her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Evans seemed more unconstrained and more
fully himself than since his unfortunate offer of himself
to Fanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fanny,” said he, after the tea things were taken
away, “I would like to ask you what is the matter,
if I thought you would like to tell me. It is no common
headache that is tormenting you; I would
sooner guess it is a heartache.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what if it is a heartache?” said Fanny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean to ask what I should have to do with
the diseases of your heart. I tell you, Fanny, I am
not as bad as you may think, or so big a fool either.
For instance, though I love you a great deal better
than Heaven, and would sooner have you for my
wife than an angel, yet knowing that you can’t love
an old codger like me, I want to see you happy with
the man of your choice, and I tell you now, for the
cure of your headache, or heartache, that you have
my consent to marry Mr. Wilson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanny burst into so violent and uncontrolled a fit
of weeping, that Mr. Evans was alarmed and puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak to me, Fanny, tell me what is all this. I
thought to give you great joy, and I only set you
weeping. Tell me, what does all this mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Cousin Charles,” said Fanny, “you have
given me the greatest joy of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you love Wilson, as I thought,” said Mr.
Evans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sigh steals down the smiling valley—a gentle
sigh of breezes, wafting happiness over the face of
nature, and at the sound from out their beds of
earth, myriads of things of beauty wake into existence;—meadow
and plain and hill-side glisten in
fairest verdure—flowers fling their fragrance on the
gale—stately trees wave their foliage to the passing
wind—while streams beneath dance onward to the
ocean—and the dream-like hum that fills the air and
swells in chorus to the arch of heaven, tells of the
blooming Spring—of the transcendent pleasures of
Life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a glorious earth has man for a habitation!
what scenes surround him to ennoble the soul—what
examples to elevate and incite the mind to strive for
the goal of Happiness. That goal, alas! how distant
and hard to reach; thorns hedge the road the aspiring
one would tread, and weeds spring rank and choking
in the pathway, or often, when the seeming height is
won, the eminence fades to a common level, and
Happiness is as distant as ever! But the soul must
toil, though success is but a vision—the mind must
work, although its labors be fruitless; for there is a
Higher power controlling the actions of man—guiding
his impulses and passions, and girding him for the
conflict around him and within him—the struggle that
is ceaselessly waging—the Battle of Life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How sweet is Fame! Even now, upon men’s
tongues there dwells some name whose every syllable
is a charm, thrilling to adoration. Here, a patriot
spirit, whose fires have smouldered long beneath
wrong and malice, rises superior to ills, and grasps—almost
the consummation of his wishes; there, a
warrior from the laureled field, receives the homage
of a grateful people; or some philosopher, with potent
wand, discloses to a wondering world a new discovery
in Science. They stand aloft upon the pinnacle
of Fortune, and eager crowds beneath echo
their praises or envy their success; and upward still
they gaze, blind to the rugged crags that lie between—blind
to the slippery height they covet—blind to
the thousands round them on the same great plain,
breathless and bleeding from their vain attempts to
climb the dazzling steep—or happy in an humbler
sphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! had they seen that lofty mind on the chill
yesterday of Adversity, with naught but obstacles
before him; who knew that Country was upon men’s
lips only as a substitute for self, and yet heard his
own efforts slandered as false and recreant, and whose
high purposes had bent before the storm only to rise
unbroken—they would not undergo the patriot’s
trials, even for his rewards. The soldier’s hardships
in the camp, with night’s cold shadows closing
round him, and no pillow for his head save the still
colder earth; or ’mid the battle’s carnage, or on the
ensanguined field, strewn alike with friends and foes,
would look not half so pleasant to their eyes as that
exulting warrior; or had they watched the student
through long years of vain research, poring o’er
musty tomes till the stars paled before the light of
day, with fevered brow and aching heart, filled with
strong hopes that time still dashed to earth—though
Time at last was destined to fulfill; the marvels
wrought thus dearly, thus hardly given to the world,
the car with wings of fire, the thought, borne as on
the lightning’s shaft, the shadow that no longer
vanishes, when won at such a cost, would lose their
value, and the philosopher stand unenvied though
pre-eminent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men judge too oft by outward show, the glitter
hides the dross which lies beneath, the peasant would
seek happiness in palaces, the rich, perchance, see
pleasures ’mid the poor; all err, all causelessly despond,
for place nor circumstance alone can make
life happy; there is no lake with breast by winds unruffled,
no sea by billows always unconvulsed—even
so is it with man. How many noble minds are
crushed beneath adversity, and pulses that ere-while
warmed with a kindred glow to kindred energies,
throb now to sorrow and bereavement? How many
hearts that loved—loved, oh, how fondly—are doomed,
alas! to live, and live alone? How many breathing
beings toil and travail on to gain wherewith they
may drag out existence—how many lots that look
the brightest, are fraught with bitterest wo!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still the strife goes on, still the throng heaves
and swells tumultuously, as waves that surge against
the rocks which bind them, and one unceasing current
flows turbulently onward, bearing with it the joys
and sorrows, the hopes and passions of a world—onward
ever, to the trackless ocean of Eternity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But fields are green and flowers are fair—then is
no warfare on the hills, nor in the groves, nor on the
plains; the elements break in fearful grandeur above;
the seasons come and go—yet sunshine follows
storms as day the night, and Winter yields to Spring.
No murmur is heard, save that which trembles
through the air, of rippling streams and stirring leaves,
and songs of sweetest music; and the works of Nature
stand forth in majestic harmony, unmoved by
the strivings around them, regardless alike of the
fears and longings, the griefs and tumults raging in
the breasts of men—serene and placid, despite the
contest, and at Peace, though amid the throes of The
Battle of Life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taste manifested by our Transcendental poets,
<span class='it'>is</span> to be treated “reverentially,” beyond doubt, as
one of Mr. Emerson’s friends suggests—for the fact is,
it is Taste on her death-bed—Taste kicking in <span class='it'>articulo
mortis</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>27.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should not say, of Taglioni, exactly that she
dances, but that she laughs with her arms and legs,
and that if she takes vengeance on her present oppressors,
she will be amply justified by the <span class='it'>lex
Talionis</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>28.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The world is infested, just now, by a new sect of
philosophers, who have not yet suspected themselves
of forming a sect, and who, consequently, have
adopted no name. They are the <span class='it'>Believers in every
thing Odd</span>. Their High Priest in the East, is Charles
Fourier—in the West, Horace Greely; and high
priests they are to some purpose. The only common
bond among the sect, is Credulity:—let us call it
Insanity at once, and be done with it. Ask any one
of them <span class='it'>why</span> he believes this or that, and, if he be
conscientious, (ignorant people usually are,) he will
make you very much such a reply as Talleyrand
made when asked why he believed in the Bible. “I
believe in it first,” said he, “because I am Bishop of
Autun; and, secondly, <span class='it'>because I know nothing about
it at all</span>.” What these philosophers call “argument,”
is a way they have “<span class='it'>de nier ce qui est et d’expliquer
ce qui n’est pas</span>.”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>29.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The goddess Laverna, who is a head without a
body, could not do better, perhaps, than make advances
to “La Jeune France,” which, for some
years to come at least, must otherwise remain a
body without a head.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>30.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. A—— is frequently spoken of as “one of our
most industrious writers;” and, in fact, when we
consider how much he has written, we perceive, at
once, that he <span class='it'>must</span> have been industrious, or he
could never (like an honest woman as he is) have so
thoroughly succeeded in keeping himself from being
“talked about.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>31.</p>

<p class='pindent'>H—— calls his verse a “poem,” very much as
Francis the First bestowed the title, <span class='it'>mes déserts</span>,
upon his snug little deer-park at Fontainebleau.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>32.</p>

<p class='pindent'>K——, the publisher, trying to be critical, talks
about books pretty much as a washerwoman would
about Niagara falls or a poulterer about a phœnix.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>33.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ingenuity of critical malice would often be
laughable but for the disgust, which, even in the most
perverted spirits, injustice never fails to excite. A
common <span class='it'>trick</span> is that of decrying, impliedly, the
higher, by insisting upon the lower, merits of an
author. Macaulay, for example, deeply feeling how
much critical acumen is enforced by cautious attention
to the mere “rhetoric” which is its vehicle, has
at length become the best of modern rhetoricians.
His <span class='it'>brother</span> reviewers—anonymous, of course, and
likely to remain so forever—extol “the acumen of
Carlyle, the analysis of Schlegel, <span class='it'>and</span> the style of
Macaulay.” Bancroft is a philosophical historian;
but no amount of philosophy has yet taught him to
despise a minute accuracy in point of fact. His
<span class='it'>brother</span> historians talk of “the grace of Prescott, the
erudition of Gibbon, <span class='it'>and</span> the pains-taking precision
of Bancroft.” Tennyson, perceiving how vividly
an imaginative effect is aided, now and then, by a
certain quaintness judiciously introduced, brings this
latter, at times, in support of his most glorious and
most delicate imagination:—whereupon his <span class='it'>brother</span>
poets hasten to laud the imagination of Mr. Somebody,
whom nobody imagined to have any, “<span class='it'>and</span> the
<a id='some'></a>somewhat affected quaintness of Tennyson.”—Let
the noblest poet add to his other excellences—if he
dares—that of faultless <a id='verse'></a>versification and scrupulous
attention to grammar. He is damned at once. His
rivals have it in their power to discourse of “A. the
true poet, <span class='it'>and</span> B. the versifier and disciple of Lindley
Murray.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>34.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That a cause leads to an effect, is scarcely more
certain than that, so far as Morals are concerned, a
repetition of effect tends to the generation of cause.
Herein lies the principle of what we so vaguely term
“Habit.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>35.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of Tennyson’s “Locksley
Hall,” I have never read a poem combining so much
of the fiercest passion with so much of the most delicate
imagination, as the “Lady Geraldine’s Courtship”
of Miss Barrett. I am forced to admit, however,
that the latter work <span class='it'>is</span> a palpable imitation of
the former, which it surpasses in thesis as much as
it falls below it in a certain calm energy, lustrous
and indomitable—such as we might imagine in a
broad river of molten gold.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>36.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What has become of the inferior planet which
Decuppis, about nine years ago, declared he saw

<p class='pindent'>“Ignorance <span class='it'>is</span> bliss”—but, that the bliss be real,
the ignorance must be so profound as not to suspect
itself ignorant. With this understanding, Boileau’s
line may be read thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<p class='line0'>“Le plus fou <span class='it'>toujours</span> est le plus satisfait,”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bryant and Street are both, essentially, descriptive
poets; and descriptive poetry, even in its happiest
manifestation, is <span class='it'>not</span> of the highest order. But the
distinction between Bryant and Street is very broad.
While the former, in reproducing the sensible images
of Nature, reproduces the sentiments with which he
regards them, the latter gives us the images and nothing
beyond. He never forces us to feel what we
feel he must have felt.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>39.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In lauding Beauty, Genius merely evinces a filial
affection. To Genius Beauty gives life—reaping
often a reward in Immortality.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>40.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this is the “American Drama” of ——! Well!—that
“Conscience which makes cowards of us all”
will permit me to say, in praise of the performance,
only that it is not quite so bad as I expected it to be.
But then I always expect too much.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>41.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What we feel to be <span class='it'>Fancy</span> will be found fanciful
still, whatever be the theme which engages it. No
<span class='it'>subject</span> exalts it into Imagination. When Moore is
termed “a fanciful poet,” the epithet is applied with
precision. He <span class='it'>is</span>. He is fanciful in “Lalla Rookh,”
and had he written the “Inferno,” in the “Inferno”
he would have contrived to be still fanciful and nothing
beyond.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>42.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we speak of “a suspicious man,” we may
mean either one who suspects, or one to be suspected.
Our language needs either the adjective “suspectful,”
or the adjective “suspectable.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>43.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To love,” says Spencer, “is</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The philosophy, here, might be rendered more profound,
by the mere omission of a comma. We all
know the <span class='it'>willing</span> blindness—the <span class='it'>voluntary</span> madness

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>OR LOVE AND LEARNING.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. CAROLINE H. BUTLER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a most provoking thing that young Harry
Warren should have fallen in love with pretty May
Lillie—he simply a village school-master whom nobody
knew—and she the only daughter of the richest
and proudest man in the whole county of Erie, whom
every body knew! It was not only very provoking,
but it was also very unfortunate for the poor fellow,
as he might as well have aspired to wed yon bright
evening star, as to lead to the altar the daughter of
Diogenes Lillie, Esq., Ex. M. C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>See the maliciousness of Fate! If May had been
but the child of some poor widow or parson—or had
Harry claimed descent from some lordly aristocrat,
the course of true love might not have run so crooked.
Leander swam the Hellespont to reach his love, breasting
bravely the surging billows, which parting before
him, bore him exultingly to the feet of Hero—but
how shall Harry force the adamantine chains with
which Mammon bars the way to happiness! Assist
him ye gods of hapless lovers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My hero was the son of a farmer, more rich in
children than in acres, and who could only afford
them in schooling, value received for a few bushels
of wheat, rye, or potatoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Harry had no taste for agriculture. The
plough furrowed his handsome countenance, and the
harrow harrowed his soul. Neither did he fancy mechanics—he
turned from the anvil, the carpenter’s
bench, the awl, and the scissors, with equal repugnance.
Books, books alone were his passion. For
these all else were neglected, the cattle strayed loose
in the fields, the pigs crept through to the garden, the
wheat remained unshocked, and the grass uncut,
while Harry under a tree lost himself amid the tattered
leaves of an old book, which every breath of
wind threatened to sweep far from him. This was a
sore trial to his father, but after fruitlessly exhausting
all his arguments to dissuade his son from the
folly of “<span class='it'>larning</span>,” he finally gave it up, and left
Harry unmolested to follow his bent. The clergyman
of the village admiring the perseverance of the
young farmer-boy, and wishing to encourage such
laudable zeal, kindly volunteered to assist him in his
studies, and with unwearied toil by night and by day,
Harry Warren was finally prepared to enter college.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the age of twenty-one he graduated honorably,
and left the college walls, his head well-stored with
knowledge—a light heart—a lighter purse, and a
strong will to persevere in the path he had marked
out for himself, a path which, after many crooked
windings, was, as his sanguine imagination assured
him, to lead him eventually on the high road to fame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To put a little money in his pocket, and at the
same time gain some leisure for study, he offered
himself as a candidate for the school in the beautiful
village of G——, some fifty miles distant from his native
town. He was accepted, and entered upon the
duties of his new office with hope and energy. And
then—the very first thing he did was to fall in love!
foolish fellow—instead of teaching the young idea to
shoot—he suffered himself to be shot—through the
sparkling roguish eyes of little May Lillie did Cupid
aim his dart—<span class='it'>twang</span>—he was gone!</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>Diogenes Lillie, Esq., professed to be a very
learned man, an immensely learned man, and his
library accordingly occupied one whole wing of his
large and costly mansion. No one far or near could
boast of so many square feet of knowledge. He patronized
the arts and sciences, and hinted at many
wonderful inventions at work in his brain, which
were in time to burst forth and astonish the world.
He also courted the muses, and was convinced that
should he once plume his flight to Parnassus, there
would be an immense fluttering among all soaring
poets, whom he should distance at once by his bold
and flashing imagery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could the eyes of poor old Dominie Sampson have
rested upon the countless volumes which like “Alps
on Alps” arose to the lofty ceiling, would not his
meagre, bony jaws have ushered in—“pro-di-gious!”
for there was one compartment devoted to theology,
another to geology, and spaces for all the <span class='it'>’ologies</span>—then
there were divisions for astronomy, for botany,
for history, for travels—there was the poet’s corner,
and the niche of romance. There were books in
French, and German, and Spanish, and Russian, and
Italian, and a mausoleum for the dead languages. I
cannot vouch that “one poor head could carry” all
this, that the brain of the great Diogenes contained
as many chambers as his library divisions—but it was
a very pleasant thing for him to gaze up and down,
and down and up, upon their costly gold-lettered
backs! Then there were also busts, and statues, and
globes, and blow-pipes, and barometers, and thermometers
scattered around, and here in this hall of
inspiration, devoted to the “sisters three and such
branches of learning,” did Mr. Lillie spend the most
of his invaluable time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now great wisdom is said to bestow upon its possessor
a contempt for wealth proportionate, which,
by the way, may be the reason why so many learned
writers and men of genius have died in a garret. If
so—there was no fear that the last breath of Diogenes
Lillie, Esq., would be drawn in an attic, for he lost
not sight of his gold in the depths of his wisdom, but
so skillfully managed his financial concerns, that
though apparently paying little heed to business, as
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
he sat there ensconced amid his books and papers,
the ball was kept constantly rolling and constantly
accumulating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet what militated most against the love of Harry
Warren, he had resolved from the time when pretty
May slipped her leading-strings, that she should be
the wife of some great man wielding authority; and
pray what virtue was there in the petty birch-twig,
or the twelve inch ruler, which were the only symbols
of authority the young school-master wielded!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, there is no need of my troubling myself
upon that head yet!” would Mr. Lillie year after
year say to himself—“May is but a child—it will be
time enough years hence to pick out a husband for
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Pick out a husband!</span> just as if the bright eyes of
May were not capable of selecting for themselves—or
that the eyes of sixty could see for those of
sixteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is in reality no need of Mr. Lillie’s troubling
himself, for the deed is done, and the little gipsy
May engaged in as pretty a flirtation, as ever spread
the rosy light of love around the hearts of youth.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>Let me exculpate my unfortunate hero from all
attempts to win the affections of his beautiful pupil.
On the contrary, it seems a mystery that his oddities
and awkwardness should have awoke any other emotion
than pity in the heart of May—for he was so
terribly ungraceful in her presence—why if he
merely spoke to her his voice was so low and tremulous,
that she had really to approach her little head
quite near to catch a word he said—and as for his
scholarship, you would have thought him a dunce, so
many egregrious blunders did he commit in hearing
her recitations—and he could no more guide her
little hand in making those pretty and delicate strokes
which marked her copy-book, than he could fly to the
moon. You would have been amazed that such a
fine, handsome young fellow, could have made such
a booby of himself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, never were scholars blessed with so indulgent
a master, and his popularity rose in proportion,
while as your lovers are for the most part but
little given to the “flesh-pots of Egypt,” he was pronounced
by all economical housewives upon whose
hospitality he was semi-monthly thrown, to possess
the most accommodating taste, and could dine from
beef and cabbage, pork and parsnips, peas porridge,
or mush and milk, with equal relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am sorry to say, that at first May joined in the
laugh with her mischievous school-mates at the oddities
of the master, and contrived many little tricks to
vex him. Yet if she raised her eyes a moment from
her book, she was sure to encounter those of Harry
fixed upon her, with an expression so mournful, yet
so tender, as bathed her cheek with blushes, and her
eyes with tears of contrition. Her frolicks therefore
soon yielded to a more pensive mood. She could
not tell why, but the thoughtless mirth of her companions
vexed and annoyed her—she no longer joined
in those idle pranks, which had for their object the
ridicule of the master, but gave way to sudden fits of
musing and abstraction. When she heard his footstep
approaching, her heart beat audibly, and in her
class she no longer raised her saucy eyes to <span class='it'>mis</span>construe
her lesson, but scarcely lifted their drooping
lids as she answered in faint tones the questions put
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, Love had conquered the merriest and
most mischievous maiden that ever laughed at his
wiles!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day in early spring, ere the snow-drop or the
crocus, had dared to lift their pretty heads above the
snowy mantle in which old winter had so long kept
them snug and warm, May placed in her bosom a
bright and beautiful rose-bud. It was the first her
little conservatory had yielded, and as she that morning
for the first time discovered it peeping through the
rich green leaves, she thought she had never seen any
thing so fresh and beautiful. Carefully plucking it
from the luxuriant branch, she bore off the fragrant
trophy to exhibit to her young companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well to be sure it was only a rose-bud—but as
Harry descried it sitting so proudly upon its pure and
lovely throne, something whispered that with that
tiny rose his fate was linked—was it thornless, or
should he wounded and complaining henceforth bid
adieu to happiness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>May caught the glance of the master, and blushed
and trembled just as if she perfectly comprehended
what was passing through his mind, and as suddenly
the little rose-bud was invested with new and tenfold
value. She would fain have hid it next her heart
from the careless gaze of her young associates, for
she felt that it had now become a sacred thing which
their touch would profane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, May bent her head over her desk, and
shook her long raven curls over her blushing cheek,
as she heard a well-known step behind her, and felt
that the large eloquent eyes of the master were fixed
upon her. But for the throbbing of her own little
heart, she could have heard the rapid pulsation of
his, while his breath almost stirred the beautiful
ringlet which rested upon her bosom. Rapidly her
little hand now moved over the slate, glancing to the
right and left, tracing figure upon figure, as though
its mistress had not a thought, but was occupied in
deciphering the rules of Coleman. It was a most
puzzling sum—never had she attempted one so difficult—in
vain she erased—in vain began again. Of
course it was all wrong, and so Harry, as in duty
bound, took the pencil and sat down by her side to
extricate her from her difficulties—as a school-master
you know, there was no other way!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, dear me—instead of looking upon the slate,
his eyes never fell a bit lower than that little rose-bud—a
pretty teacher, to be sure!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ahem</span>—that is a beautiful rose, Miss May!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—you are fond of flowers, I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are a favorite study of mine—are you
much versed in the language of flowers, my—<span class='it'>ahem</span>—Miss
May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They always speak to me of God’s love and goodness,”
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
replied May, as demurely as if she had been
answering her minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, dear Miss May,” said Harry. “They are
indeed, as the poet says—‘the smiles of angels’ blessing
and cheering us on our earthly pilgrimage—but
aside from this heavenly mission, the poet has also
bestowed upon them another language:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“‘In eastern lands they talk in flowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And they tell in a garland their loves and cares,</p>
<p class='line0'>Each blossom that blooms in their garden bowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On its leaves a mystic language bears.’</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“Is it so—do you believe this, May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May made no answer, but bent her head still lower
over the book before her, and the little rose-bud trembled
as though moved by some breath of summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The—the rose, May,” continued Harry, “seems
to have been ever a favorite and expressive flower
of this mystic garland:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“‘The rose is the sign of joy and love,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Young blushing love in its earliest dawn.’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May—May, will you give me the rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May timidly raised her eyes to his—they were filled
with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you, May—will you give me the rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment the little bud was in the hand of
the transported Harry, accompanied with a look of
such innocent, confiding love, as made his heart dance
with rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was there ever in after life a moment of such pure
and exquisite happiness as then filled the hearts of
the lovers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the rose-bud, the poor rose-bud, bitterly did
it rue the change from its lovely resting-place
to the great hand of the school-master—besides
coming very near being crushed to pieces between
that and the dainty little fingers of May as she placed
it therein!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it must have been a puzzling sum indeed to
keep the master so long at May Lillie’s desk! and
taking advantage of his inattention, the mischievous
scholars carried on a pretty little by-play of their
own—there was tittering in corners, and whispering
behind torn covers—and soft, soft tiptoeing from one
seat to another, and little paper pellets flying like
hail-stones from side to side. Ah, dear, happy children—there
is no danger—you might knock the master’s
head off, and he would never know it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young ladies—children—I give you a holyday,”
quoth Harry, rapping his desk with the dread ferule,
insignia of his power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A holyday—<span class='it'>huzza—huzza</span>—a holyday!” shouted
the girls and boys, rushing from the school-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the older girls looked slyly at each other, and
then at the blushing May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look—look!” exclaimed half-a-dozen in a breath.
“The master is walking home with May Lillie!”</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>Diogenes Lillie, Esq., sat in his study. Around
him were gathered all those powerful incentives necessary
to call forth that great masterly genius which
lay hid somewhere in his brain—somewhere—from
whence, though many times coaxed and flattered, it
had as yet resolutely refused to stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the table before him, bearing at each corner
respectively a bust of Plato, of Shakspeare, Homer,
and Milton, were pamphlets, reviews, folios, quartos
and duodecimos, thickly strewn—but what was more
to the purpose, there was drawn up close to the elbow
of Mr. Lillie, a quire of hot-pressed letter-paper, with
edges of gold—a silver standish, bearing the golden
pen ingrafted in a feather of pearl, and the cerulean
ink with which genius should indite the virgin page,
whenever said genius should deign to issue from its
dark hiding-place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lips of Diogenes were closely pressed together—his
eyes upturned with a frenzied glare to
the ceiling, and deep indentations, like the rind of a
musk-melon, corrugated his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reader—he was conceiving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bringing down his clinched hand with a force
which made old Homer nod, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will write. Yes, I will write a poem—I will
astonish the world—my talents shall no longer remain
under a bushel, but shall go forth like the sword
of Gideon to hew down all minor poets! Upon what
theme shall I first spend my genius—let me consider,”
(drawing the paper still nearer and dipping the
golden pen into the flowing liquid,) “gold—the Age
of Gold—the Golden Age—yes, ‘The Golden Age’ it
shall be. My sublimity shall throw Milton into the
shade,” (with a look at the blind bard)—“my glowing
pictures of rural life shall startle the lovers of
Homer,” (a bow to the god)—“my wit shall cut with
the keen sarcasm of Shakspeare,” (looking glorious
Will full in the face)—“while the <span class='it'>tout-ensemble</span>
shall form such a completeness of wisdom, as might
honor even the head of a Plato!” (a triumphant
glance at the old philosopher.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus encouraged, the gold pen capered, and
flashed, and flourished from side to side like a mad
thing—pointing notes of admiration here, dotting and
scratching there, and then diving deep into the sea of
ink, plumed its pearly pinion for new and higher
flights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three weeks did the poet bury himself in his
library with dead and living authors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And every morning he kissed his pretty May-flower
as she tied on her little bonnet:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there—go along child; be a good girl and
obey the master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then as she came to bid him good-night:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, there; go to bed, child, and don’t forget
your lessons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not she, bless her! Why she never forgot a single
lesson the school-master taught her—she had every
word by heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the Golden Age was ready to burst like
a blazing star upon this dull coppery world, and was
the most sublime thing, in the opinion of its author,
that was ever written—and who, pray, could be a
better judge!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Mr. Lillie having some conception of the ignorance
of the critics, having once (although it is a
great secret,) sent a huge MSS. to the Harpers, which
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
was pronounced “<span class='it'>stuff</span>”—it might have been very
good stuff notwithstanding—resolved that ere he essayed
the publishers, he would give his unique poem
in all its unfledged beauty to his native village. It
was a capital idea. It should be delivered before the
Lyceum to an astonished audience. He could then
have some faint idea perhaps of the applause which
awaited its appearance in 12mo., calf and gilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening he dispatched a hasty note to our
young school-master, and requested to see him immediately
upon business of a private nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavens how poor Harry trembled as he perused
this terrible summons! All was discovered then—Mr.
Lillie knew of his presumptuous love, and had
sent to banish him forever from the presence of May.
And then our little heroine—into what an agony of
doubt and apprehension was she thrown, as she read
the billet which Harry contrived to slip into her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the hour appointed, with an unsteady hand,
Harry knocked at the door of Mr. Lillie’s library.
The great Diogenes himself appeared at the threshhold—and
imagine the surprise of our hero to be
greeted with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in, come in, my dear sir—I am most happy
to see you,” (shaking him warmly by the hand.) “Sit
down, Mr. Warren,” (motioning to a seat at the table
of the gods.) “It has long been my wish to know
you better than my very limited time would allow—my
pursuits” (glancing complacently around him,)
“are a great bar to social intercourse. The muses,
Mr. Warren, the muses I find are very jealous
ladies—do you cultivate their acquaintance? No?
Ah, I am surprised, for I assure you I have formed
a very high opinion of your talents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry bowed, and said something about honor,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter, Mr. Warren,” (ah! now it is coming!
thought poor Harry,) “my daughter, I am inclined
to believe, has made great proficiency under
your instruction—you have my thanks for initiating
her into some of the more abstruse sciences which
she never before attended to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did Harry dream, or was the wrath of Mr. Lillie
veiled under the most cutting irony! He could only
bow, and smile “a ghastly smile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And speaking of the Muses, my dear young sir,”
continued Mr. Lillie, “I have just been amusing
myself with a trifle—a mere flight of fancy—if you
have a few moments leisure now, I will read you a
few passages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course our hero considered himself favored—and
accordingly with true bombastic style Mr. Lillie
read several stanzas from the closely written pages
of his poem. Never had Harry listened to such trash—he
could hardly credit his senses that any man
should be so inflated with vanity as to deem it even
passable!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, it strikes you I see,” said Mr. Lillie. “I
knew it would. Yes, I see it hits your vein exactly—this
convinces me that our tastes are congenial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Harry bowed—not daring to trust his voice,
he was forced to nod his head continually like a Chinese
mandarin in a toy-shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Warren,” proceeded the author, wheeling
his chair round and regarding our hero with great benignity,
“I have imbibed a great regard for you, and
mean to make your fortune—to smooth your path to
eminence. Yes, I like you, and am convinced there
is no one more worthy than yourself to receive——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry started—his face radiant with hope, he bent
eagerly forward to catch the rest of the sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, by the way, my young friend, this conversation
must be strictly confidential.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, my dear sir!” exclaimed Harry, almost
breathless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Warren, there is something about you
which pleases me, and therefore I am about to confer
upon you a most precious gift—to bestow upon
you my—ah, can’t you guess what it is?” smiling
archly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, my dear sir,” said Harry, seizing his hand,
“if I might dare to hope!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Warren, I am about to give you my—poem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your poem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your poem!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my poem—that is, the reputation of the
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry started up and paced the room as if pursued
by all the furies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I thought I should surprise you,” cried Mr.
Lillie. “Come, sit down again. I said I would
make your fortune, and I will. Now this poem, Mr.
Warren, you shall have the honor of delivering before
the Lyceum as your own—think of that—as your
own production.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Harry was struck aghast. “But, my dear
sir,” he exclaimed, “I can never consent to such a
gross imposition!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I honor you the more for your delicacy young
man,” replied the poet; “but banish it—there is no
need of it between friends, we perfectly understand
each other you know—you shall deliver this poem.”
(“The Lord deliver me!” mentally prayed Harry.)
“Listeners will applaud—copies will be solicited—your
fame will reach the city—Morris and Willis
will rank you among their favorite young
poets—the——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mr. Lillie, why not deliver this poem yourself—why
not wear your own laurels?” interrupted
Harry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ahem</span>—Mr. Warren, I am averse to popularity—notoriety
of any kind I detest—I prefer to quaff
stealthily at the fount of Helicon, and tread with felted
footsteps the Parnassian hill—stop, that’s a new
idea, I’ll note it. So long as I have the mental satisfaction
of knowing the <span class='it'>poem is mine</span>, what matters
it whether you or I have the reputation! Say no
more—you accept my proposition of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Lillie—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word, my dear sir—I will take care that
you are invited to deliver the next Lyceum lecture—two
weeks hence remember. That gives you ample
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
time to study the poem and conceive my meaning.
Come here every evening—you shall have my assistance.
I will not detain you longer—good-night.
You will find May somewhere—in the drawing-room
most probably; she will be glad to see you, for I dare
say she is puzzling her little head about something
which you can explain. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This latter clause sufficed to check all further opposition
from Harry, for the moment at least, and
with rapid steps he now sought the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Harry!” cried May, springing toward him
as he entered, and looking up in his face as if to read
there the stern mandate which was to separate them
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest May, do not tremble thus,” replied
Harry, leading her to a seat; “believe me you have
no cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—does he then approve of our love!” exclaimed
May, her sweet young face illumined with
hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father has been kind, my dear girl, and that
he does not even suspect our love I am convinced,
or he would have been less so. His kindness, however,
if it may be called so,” (and the lip of Harry
curled doubtingly,) “has placed me in a most awkward
predicament. Listen, dear May, and help me
if you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then as briefly as possible related the conversation
he had just held with her father, and the
strange proposition made him. No wonder he felt
provoked at the merry laugh with which the little
maiden closed his rueful communication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confess now, Harry, you deem papa’s poem
most execrable stuff!” she said, looking him archly
in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear May, you know I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confess, confess Harry—no equivocation!” cried
May, shaking her little finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, May, I will be honest then—you know,
dear one, I would not for worlds wound your feelings,
but really I must confess I never listened to
more senseless jargon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s excellent—the more absurd the better,”
said May, laughing; “and you will deliver it,
Harry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May!” exclaimed her lover reproachfully, “<span class='it'>you</span>
surely cannot ask me to make myself ridiculous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Hem</span>—do you love me, Harry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you doubt, it dearest May?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then if you love me, as Hamlet says, ‘speak the
speech I pray you.’ No doubt it will be hissed—so
much the better—you will be laughed at—better
still—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May, May!” cried her lover, turning away from
her, “if you loved me you would not say this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah—not if it gains papa’s consent to our union!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That indeed—but, dearest May, to become a
laughing-stock—to have the finger of derision pointed
at one—to feel the lash of the critic, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To call little May your own!” added the coaxing
gipsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who could resist such an appeal from such a pair
of rosy lips? or unrelenting behold the mute eloquence
of those beautiful eyes! Not Harry; no, nor
any other young lover I am sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that evening, dear reader, only imagine my
unlucky hero imprisoned hour after hour with the
learned author, declaiming that—“infernal poem,”
(I quote Harry’s own words.) Do you not pity him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But then—the stolen half hour below, assisting
little May in her lessons—do you not envy him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime Mr. Lillie had not been idle. He
had forwarded letters to some of the most influential
men of the neighboring towns, inviting them to attend
the next Lyceum, where as he informed them,
a young author, a poet, was to make his <span class='it'>début</span> before
their intelligent community. In confidence he assured
them they would be astonished at the depth and
power of his genius. He had himself looked over
the poem, and although he would not wish to forestall
their admiration, thus much he would say, that
he had never read such a production!</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>The eventful evening arrived, and from every
turnpike and cross-road people came flocking in to
listen to the young author—some because of the favor
of Mr. Lillie, others to compliment their favorite—the
school-master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Escorted by the great and learned Diogenes Lillie,
Esq., and a few of the leading members, Harry was
conducted to the hall, and seated within the inclosure
of the platform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To depict his feelings would be impossible—he
knew he was about to make himself ridiculous, and
was tempted more than once to turn his back and
quit the scene of his approaching disgrace. Notwithstanding
the tempting reward he had in view, the
alternative was a hard one—but his eye turned to a
distant corner of the hall where the sweet face of
May smiled upon him, and her fair hand waved encouragement.
He wavered no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resolving to meet his fate like a hero, Harry now
arose, and after a few preliminaries introduced—“The
Golden Age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two first stanza elicited a general smile from
the audience, the third and fourth exerted a different
influence—influenza became universal, to judge from
the coughing and <span class='it'>hem-ming</span>! Between the fifth and
sixth, many persons left the house, and as Harry with
the energy of despair drew near the close of the first
canto, the hissing and hooting of boys outside and in
the building was almost deafening, while one of the
committee arose and advised the orator to sit down!</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the self-satisfaction of a martyr he was preparing
to do so, when his eye suddenly fell upon the
<span class='it'>author</span>, whom he detected at a glance to be the most
active in the war of ridicule which was waging
against him. Rage for the moment overcame his
discretion. Hurling the manuscript upon the floor,
he sprang from the desk, made one leap down the
steps, and rushed upon his deceitful patron!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you dare to laugh at me!” he exclaimed, pale
with anger, “do you dare to utter a word, you—you
who are yourself the—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little hand was on his arm, and a soft voice
whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
“Harry, dear Harry, come away.” And obeying
the gentle mandate our hero suffered himself to be
led from the scene of his mortification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow!” cried Mr. Lillie, recovering from
the alarm of Harry’s onset, “poor fellow, he is almost
beside himself I see—well, it is pitiful trash
after all, and I fear I gave him too much encouragement,
my friendship got the better of my judgment—yet
his delivery is the worst—why I am not sure gentlemen
but his ranting and mouthing would render
even Shakspeare ridiculous. The poem <span class='it'>reads</span> well—depend
upon it gentlemen there is genius after all
where that poem came from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Lillie reached home he found Harry
awaiting him, storming and raving to and fro <a id='fro'></a>in the library
like a madman. Rushing upon the great Diogenes
he seized him by the collar:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your conduct is unbearable!” he exclaimed.
“You shall do me justice, sir—by heaven you shall!
I am not to be treated in this way! After palming
off your wretched stuff upon me, do you think I am
going to submit to your ridicule! No, sir—either go
forward and acknowledge yourself openly as the
author, or I will post you at every corner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be calm, pray be calm—we’ll settle it all in a
moment,” said Mr. Lillie, pale and trembling—“I
am really sorry your first essay should have been so
unsuccessful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first essay!” interrupted Harry indignantly.
“I am not to be trifled with—no, sir—I will expose
you at once—it is you who shall bear the ridicule,
not me!” and Harry rushed to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop—stop—my dear young friend,” cried Mr.
Lillie, catching his arm—“listen a moment; for heaven’s
sake don’t expose me, it will be my ruin. I
will give you any thing you ask if you will only
spare me—you shall have money—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Money!</span> Can money repair the disgrace you
have heaped upon me—talk of money to a man who
feels his future hopes blasted!” exclaimed Harry
scornfully. “Sir, there is but one way to save your
reputation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is that dear sir?” eagerly demanded
the author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me the hand of your daughter,” he replied
firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter, Mr. Warren—why you astonish
me—my daughter!” and Mr. Lillie paused and pondered,
bit his lips and rubbed his eyebrows. “Why
bless my soul, Mr. Warren, May is but a child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter,” was the answer, “will you or will
you not accept my proposition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will not five hundred dollars, Mr. Warren—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—nor five hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Warren, only don’t expose me; only
pledge me your word of honor that my secret shall
be inviolate and May is yours!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry calmed down wonderfully quick, considering
he had been in such a passion, and very obligingly
made all the pledges his father-in-law that was to be
required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is one thing, Mr. Warren, which I
must leave to your generosity,” said Mr. Lillie.
“May is my only, and a motherless child—if this arrangement
should be repugnant to her feelings, I trust
you will not press your claim—we may perhaps find
some other way to adjust this little difficulty. I will
call May down, we may as well know at once what
her feelings are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry coughed, and walked to the window to conceal
a smile, feeling at the same time more respect
for Mr. Lillie for this last clause in favor of his child,
than he thought him capable of inspiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One glance at the happy countenance of her lover
informed May the day was theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she immediately took a great many airs
upon herself—pouted her pretty lips, and protested
she thought it really absurd the idea of marrying a
man who had made himself so ridiculous—she doted
on poets, that she was willing to allow—but not
such a conceited fellow as wrote that poem—she
knew!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harry meanwhile whistled “Rory O’More,” and
walked the room with an air as much as to say—“It
is perfectly indifferent to me, Miss, which ever way
you decide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, foolish child!” whispered her father, “the
poem is <span class='it'>mine</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours, dear papa—oh that alters the case—then
you wrote that stup—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush—hush May. The public are fools, and cannot
appreciate true genius—the poem is a good
poem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it has point, papa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and if those stupid ignoramuses had not
made such an outcry, they would have seen that it
terminates most felicitously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, papa—one certainly could not wish for a
happier termination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you see, May, I have particular reasons for
not wishing to be known as the author—and this
poor young man feeling much chafed by the treatment
he has received, and which is perfectly natural
you know—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, papa—the school-master is very sensitive.
Mercy, if you only knew—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no matter now—and feeling as I said,
greatly incensed, he threatens to expose me. You
can save me May—your hand will make all
secure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, dear papa—Mr. Warren has always
been kind to me in school, and I like him very well—I
do papa, and so to oblige you I will do as you
wish,” said the arch maiden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking her hand, her father now led her up to
Harry, and placed it within that of the enraptured
lover. And May, dropping a little courtesy, very
gravely assured him that she would endeavor to make
as obedient a wife as she had a pupil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madam Rumor is a prying gossip. How she
found out the secret was never known—but away
she went gadding from house to house, whispering
the school-master had obtained his charming young
wife by fathering the literary bantling of the learned
Mr. Lillie!</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;When with glances far and free</p>
<p class='line'>My Spirit stood at Childhood’s knee,</p>
<p class='line'>And gazed and smiled with careless glee,</p>
<p class='line'>To see the fateful spinsters three</p>
<p class='line'>Draw deftly out from carded naught</p>
<p class='line'>Its first soft rainbow thread of thought,</p>
<p class='line'>My playmate true, delight and joy,</p>
<p class='line'>Was a tiny wingéd boy.</p>
<p class='line'>Nightly nestled in my breast,</p>
<p class='line'>His legends lulled me to my rest;</p>
<p class='line'>Thence his voice awakening gay</p>
<p class='line'>Trilled back the early linnet’s lay;</p>
<p class='line'>In the bird’s nest, in the tree,</p>
<p class='line'>By the purling rill sat he;</p>
<p class='line'>From wind-rocked blue-bells flashed his eye;</p>
<p class='line'>He floated round the butterfly;</p>
<p class='line'>His little golden head rose up</p>
<p class='line'>In the water-lily’s cup;</p>
<p class='line'>His saucy breath, with nectar fed,</p>
<p class='line'>Puffed at me from the violet’s bed.</p>
<p class='line'>Half in sport and half caress;</p>
<p class='line'>Oh, dear artless Happiness!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Womanhood one day me found,</p>
<p class='line'>And my brows with roses crowned.</p>
<p class='line'>In a naiad’s glass I saw,</p>
<p class='line'>Pleased, my graces touched with awe;</p>
<p class='line'>And “These royal flowers shall be</p>
<p class='line'>Forged to links, my boy, for thee,”</p>
<p class='line'>So I said. From morn till eve</p>
<p class='line'>Through my haunts the shepherds grieve;</p>
<p class='line'>But the urchin bursts amain</p>
<p class='line'>Shouting from my bloomy chain,</p>
<p class='line'>Bursts and leaves me all forlorn,</p>
<p class='line'>Pricked and bleeding with a thorn.</p>
<p class='line'>“Why thus wrong my gentleness,</p>
<p class='line'>Light, inconstant Happiness!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;All in tears to bring me ease,</p>
<p class='line'>Back he flew, and made his peace;</p>
<p class='line'>And my every art I tried</p>
<p class='line'>Aye to keep him at my side;</p>
<p class='line'>April floods of tears and smiles,</p>
<p class='line'>Soft confessions, simple wiles;</p>
<p class='line'>Then I seized my harp and sang;</p>
<p class='line'>Far and wide the chorus rang;</p>
<p class='line'>(Round me flocked the grave, the gay,</p>
<p class='line'>But the rover would not stay;)</p>
<p class='line'>“Peerless, wronged, thy votaress,</p>
<p class='line'>Cruel, fleeting, Happiness.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Oft and oftener still his flight;</p>
<p class='line'>Longer still he shunned my sight;</p>
<p class='line'>Till I left my woodlands dim,</p>
<p class='line'>And set forth in quest of him</p>
<p class='line'>To the tourney, feast and ball,</p>
<p class='line'>(In their turn I peeped at all,)</p>
<p class='line'>Court, and hermitage, and camp,</p>
<p class='line'>Still halls where burns the midnight lamp,</p>
<p class='line'>And the sunk-eyed scholar delves</p>
<p class='line'>Slowly through the groaning shelves,</p>
<p class='line'>Where old souls, that erst were men,</p>
<p class='line'>Speak and teach the young again,</p>
<p class='line'>And, while creation’s bounds they track,</p>
<p class='line'>Cast their endless shadows back;</p>
<p class='line'>Vainly still I sought to find</p>
<p class='line'>Him I sought among mankind.</p>
<p class='line'>Still his semblance proved to be</p>
<p class='line'>Garish Mirth or Vanity;</p>
<p class='line'>And still of all I sought in vain</p>
<p class='line'>Good tidings of the lost to gain.</p>
<p class='line'>The scholar said, “In poet’s book;”</p>
<p class='line'>The poet, “In some leafy nook;”</p>
<p class='line'>“Oh, which?” “I know not yet,” he says,</p>
<p class='line'>“Go thou and seek—’mid clustering bays;”</p>
<p class='line'>The lawyer, “In the judge’s gown;”</p>
<p class='line'>The judge, “In ermine’s lordly down;”</p>
<p class='line'>The peer, “He’s in my liege’s crown;”</p>
<p class='line'>The king, “He rides the victor’s glaive;”</p>
<p class='line'>And he, “In peaceful Lethe’s wave,</p>

<p class='line'>“Nay, I know he can’t be there!</p>
<p class='line'>Pride shall bravely fill thy place,</p>
<p class='line'>False and treacherous Happiness!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Prim sat Pride, then dropped asleep,</p>
<p class='line'>Leaving me to watch and weep.</p>
<p class='line'>Round my dimpled shoulders clung</p>
<p class='line'>My dewy locks at random flung;</p>
<p class='line'>Wildered strayed my fleecy band;</p>
<p class='line'>Loosed the crook my listless hand,</p>
<p class='line'>Playing with the dreary rue</p>
<p class='line'>At my cavern’s mouth that grew,</p>
<p class='line'>And forgot its tuneful craft.</p>
<p class='line'>At my plight the shepherds laughed;</p>
<p class='line'>“She is sick at heart, you know;</p>
<p class='line'>She loved,—wise maidens do not so;</p>
<p class='line'>So fare all idle fools who chase</p>
<p class='line'>The subtle, coy sprite, Happiness!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Dropped its silver balls from sight</p>
<p class='line'>The starry clepsydra of night;</p>
<p class='line'>And the morn brought jocund glee</p>
<p class='line'>To the world, and not to me,</p>
<p class='line'>“Would I ne’er had seen thy face,</p>
<p class='line'>Happiness, lost Happiness!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Stung with swarms of wretchedness,</p>
<p class='line'>I plunged into the wilderness;</p>
<p class='line'>Toward the Eastern land of spells</p>
<p class='line'>Me some secret power impels;</p>
<p class='line'>“There some wily witch,” I thought,</p>
<p class='line'>“In her toils the boy has caught.”</p>
<p class='line'>Through the shadows, through the sun,</p>
<p class='line'>And surging sands I journeyed on,</p>
<p class='line'>Till the sun his gold lance set</p>
<p class='line'>In rest to prick from Olivet.</p>
<p class='line'>Glorious light the morrow showed.</p>
<p class='line'>Nor to him its lustre owed.</p>
<p class='line'>Up the steep of Zion’s hill</p>
<p class='line'><span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span></p>
<p class='line'>Rose a being brighter still.</p>
<p class='line'>Silvery white the garb she wore,</p>
<p class='line'>And a cross of flowers she bore;</p>
<p class='line'>From vulgar gaze her charms, amid</p>
<p class='line'>A dark, enshrining mask, she hid,</p>
<p class='line'>Lighted up like midnight skies</p>
<p class='line'>With the splendor of her eyes;</p>
<p class='line'>Her dainty feet, with sandals shod,</p>
<p class='line'>Scarce touched the ragged road she trod,</p>
<p class='line'>And a pearly scallop-shell</p>
<p class='line'>Gleamed her pilgrim state to tell.</p>
<p class='line'>Dully, long I strove to see</p>
<p class='line'>What that which bore her train could be;</p>
<p class='line'>Now on this side, now on that,</p>
<p class='line'>Now it met a chiding pat,</p>
<p class='line'>For resting on her skirts to impede,</p>
<p class='line'>Impishly, her upward speed,</p>
<p class='line'>From frowning cliff and wayside stone,</p>
<p class='line'>Flitting far, as bribes, it won</p>
<p class='line'>Blossoms fair and held before,</p>
<p class='line'>As her constancy to lure.</p>
<p class='line'>Graciously she marked its play;</p>
<p class='line'>Steadfastly she held her way.</p>
<p class='line'>Changed of mood, with tender gloom</p>
<p class='line'>It hung its garlands o’er a tomb.</p>
<p class='line'>Full in view thence reared its head,</p>
<p class='line'>Looked at me and beckoned,</p>
<p class='line'>Then, as if perforce, again</p>
<p class='line'>Fled and bore the lady’s train;</p>
<p class='line'>Thick my heart’s full throbs confess</p>
<p class='line'>“Surely that was Happiness!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Panting, staring, faint, I stood,</p>
<p class='line'>Then with foot and tongue pursued;</p>
<p class='line'>“Sorceress, fiend—whate’er ye be—</p>
<p class='line'>Tear not thus my fere from me!</p>
<p class='line'>I defy the loathly charms</p>

<p class='line'>I will rend thy mask away!</p>
<p class='line'>I will give those charms <a id='today'></a>to-day!”</p>
<p class='line'>My whirlwind race was won, and lo!</p>
<p class='line'>I tore it from her blushing brow,</p>
<p class='line'>My foster-sister’s, Holiness!</p>
<p class='line'>And her page was Happiness!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;Oh, I owned her might too well!</p>
<p class='line'>Groveling in the dust I fell!</p>
<p class='line'>Then wondering heard a whisper low,</p>
<p class='line'>“Let’s be friends, my causeless foe.”</p>
<p class='line'>Doubtfully I raised my eyes;</p>
<p class='line'>Down she gazed with mild surprise.</p>
<p class='line'>Naught to fear I saw was there,</p>
<p class='line'>But purity and beauty rare.</p>
<p class='line'>As she raised me with a kiss,</p>
<p class='line'>Through her veil laughed Happiness.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;When I slumber at her feet</p>
<p class='line'>Light pinions scatter odors sweet;</p>
<p class='line'>While her step keeps pace with mine</p>
<p class='line'>Round my neck soft fingers twine;</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_13'>NO. II.—A LONELY WEEK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One of the loneliest hours I felt in two years of
absence from my country, was on an afternoon in
April, after leaving the gate of Cassel, in Northern
Germany. There I had parted from Carl K——, a
young student, whom I had met for the first time two
days before, on entering the city. We met, strangers
though we were, and ignorant of each other’s
name or condition, like old acquaintances who had
been long separated; an invisible link seemed at
once to attach us in friendship and confidence. He
was a boy of seventeen, but already a poet, possessing
a nature full of enthusiasm and the sorrowful inspiration
of song. His heart beat with all true and
tender impulses, and in its yet unfathomed depths
there was a capacity for boundless passion. In those
two days we were constantly together; we climbed
the slopes of the Wilhelmshöhe, fragrant with early
cowslips; we wandered among the giant ruins of the
Katzenberg; we sat in the rich library, poring over
the old illuminated pages of the Song of Hildebrand.
When the time of parting came, it was a struggle for
both of us, and as we gave the last warm pressure of
hands at the gate of Cassel, his dark, mournful eyes
were full of tears, and I turned away with a mist
gathering over my own. I climbed the long hill
which was to shut out all sight of the valley, with a
feeling amounting to bitterness, heightened by the
languid and feverish sensations of approaching illness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hazy sunshine shone warmly on the bare, bleak
fields beside the road, and as the day wore away, my
spirits sank down, down, into a bottomless gulf of
despondency. The coolness of the woods into which
the road finally led as it descended the hills of the
Weser, made me shiver, though my veins were
parched with heat. I threw myself down on the
grass, and looked up into the gray sky, that I might
lose the feeling of loneliness in its vast and sympathizing
presence. This is always an encouraging
contemplation, and I was aided by it in the present
instance. I made out to reach the city of Münden
before dark, and slept as I best could, a disturbed, unrefreshing
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, feeling unable to walk, I took the
<span class='it'>eilwagen</span> to Göttingen, where I remained two days,
and in spite of medicine and a physician, grew no
better. It rained continually, and shut up in my
chamber with no company but my own thoughts, which
were by no means entertaining companions, I looked
back with regret to the home-like comforts of Frankfort
and Heidelberg. Sickness is <a id='syn'></a>synonymous with
impatience in my vocabulary, and after two days’
trial of repose, I determined to continue my journey,
trusting to the influences of scenery and exercise.
Accordingly I took the <span class='it'>eilwagen</span> to Nordheim, twenty
miles nearer the Hartz, as it was raining heavily.
In the capacious and cushioned vehicle, traveling was
tolerable enough and I reached Nordheim at nightfall
in better spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the damp, gloomy inn, after the stage rolled off,
my fever returned. I went to bed, and lay awake
for hours, listening to the rain beating on the windows
and the monotonous wail of the wind down the
valley. The rest of the night must have been passed
either in the wildest dreaming, or in a waking fever
bordering on delirium. My head throbbed painfully,
and imaginary voices seemed calling me from a distance.
Strange figures walked through the room
and stood long, looking out the window. Some were
familiar faces—faces of friends far away—and some
that I knew not, spoke to me, or talked with each
other till my brain was confused with the noises, and
toward morning I slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day the sky was dark, without rain. I
was weak, though no worse, and set out on foot,
aided by a stout staff, toward the Hartz. In spite of
the labor of plodding along the muddy roads, I was
refreshed by the cool damp atmosphere and inspired
by the scenery, which grew wilder and lonelier as I
advanced. Spring, although late for Germany, had
already covered the forests with their first light green
foliage, and the meadows were luxuriant with grass
and flowers. Whenever I grew weary, there was
always a bank of moss somewhere under the pine-trees
which the rain had not reached, and like Uhland
with his apple-tree, I greeted the pine as my landlord,
who, if he could spread me no board from his
juicy larder, at least kept for me his best arm-chair,
and with the thatch of his roof protected me from the
frequent showers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So passed the day, with no incident except the
challenge of a gend’arme, who could read no part of
my passport but the name “America,” in honor of
which he made a stiff military salute and wished a
pleasant journey. In the old, decaying village of Osterode,
sunk deep among gypsum quarries in the valley
of the Oder, I made a dinner of milk and black
bread, and as it was late in the afternoon, pushed on
to reach Herzberg, at the entrance of the Hartz. As
the black and gusty sky deepened into night, I was
joined by a traveling handwerker, who made the
way shorter by his cheery conversation, half talk and
half singing. We stopped at a little one-story inn,
called, even in that unknown corner of the world,
the “London House.” The peasants employed by
the landlord, who was rich in possessing several
acres of barren meadow land, had just collected for
supper, and we sat down with them at the table.
An immense wooden bowl, filled with steaming potatoes,
was placed in the middle, and a choppin of beer
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
set before each one. They used neither knife, fork
nor plate, but took the potatoes in their fingers, and
salted them from another dish with the same convenient
appliances. I was civilized enough to ask for
a plate and to call for tea instead of beer, at which
these stout men and maidens were greatly amused.
There was considerable doubt at first whether the
last article could be had, but the <span class='it'>frau</span>, after some
search, produced a package of the kind called Russian
tea, which is brought overland to Russia through
Tartary, and retains the delicate aroma of the shrub
in a much greater degree than that which reaches us
by a long sea-voyage from Canton. At least, it
seemed to me, in my exhausted state, nothing short
of nectar, and after some talk with the good people of
the inn, who, enjoying only the merest necessities of
life gave me a new lesson in the requisites of happiness,
I went to bed in the loft and slept till my companion,
the handwerker, awoke me at breakfast-time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our roads, unfortunately, were different. He was
bound to Alexisbad on the southern edge of the Hartz,
while I was for a visit to His Phantomship, the
Spectre of the Brocken. So we parted, with mutual
wishes of good luck, and I plunged into the grand
mountain defile in front of Herzberg, my knapsack
heavier by a loaf of bread. Thenceforward my way
was solitude itself. The steeps on either side were
clothed to the summit with woods of black pine, with
here and there a single larch, of a pale and misty
green, like the ghost of a tree. The brawling river
ran over cold black rocks, and even where the hills
left a little eddy of meadow between them, the winter
floods swept it bare and prevented the peasant
from planting his scanty harvest. The only houses
were those of the woodmen and mountain herdsmen—the
only sounds of human life the stroke of axes
among the pines and the shout of men and boys driving
their cattle up to the cleared places, which were
already covered with thick grass. Snow-drifts still
lay in the clefts of the rocks and under the boughs of
trees which had been felled. Over this stern and
lonely region was a dark and lowering sky and the
only things that were truly bright and joyous were
the crimson pinks that grew by the wayside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I overtook a herdsman with his two boys driving
their cows and goats up the valley, and we walked
some time in company. With a frank curiosity he
asked me why I traveled alone in the Hartz. It was
too early, he said, to climb the Brocken, and then
nobody went there without company. People said
there were still spirits and witches among the hills,
and I might easily lose the path and wander about till
after night-fall, when I would be in their power.
The boys listened to his warnings with perfect belief
in their faces. I asked them if they had ever seen
those witches, “No,” they answered, but they had
never been further than Andreasberg; yet the miners
had told them of kobolds who guard the veins of ore
and smothered them to death when they came too
near their dwellings. The old herdsman said he had
climbed the Brocken many years before, in the summer
time, and added, “but we took good care to come
down again before night.” I promised him to be
careful about the road and not to be belated when the
witches were abroad, but he still seemed unwilling
that I should go alone. “Here are the cattle to take
care of,” said he, “but Ernest and Gottlieb could do
that; if it were not for the wood I must cut, I would
go with you myself the whole way.” If my purse
had been a little heavier, I would have paid him for
the lost work, and taken him along. This I could
not do, and when he reached the path which led to
his pasturage, I shook hands with him and repeated
my promises. “I hope you may be lucky,” was the
last he said, “but I wish I could go along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still climbing beside the stream, the road finally
grew rough and narrow, hemmed by mountains too
high and bleak as yet for pasture. I reached a pass
where it was completely covered by an overhanging
rock, and sat down to compare the directions of my
guide-book with the appearances around me. I had
come to the conclusion that I was in the wrong path,
when two or three miners came under the other end
of the rock. They confirmed my suspicions, but
told me they were going to Andreasburg by a path
over the mountain on our right and if I followed them
I should gain what I had lost. This was a fortunate
chance; I shouldered my knapsack and took the path,
which was so steep and narrow that we climbed
single file through the woods. It was half an hour
before we reached the summit and I felt like sinking
to the earth from fatigue, for my guides were strong-winded
and athletic and went steadily forward, without
taking breath. I kept pace with them in the
descent, and learned from them something of their
under-ground life and the extent and productiveness
of the mines. This part of the Hartz is very rich in
minerals, the mines producing gold, silver, lead, copper
and iron. Some of them have been worked
seven or eight centuries, and the deep shafts extend
more than two thousand feet under the earth’s surface.
The great mine at Andreasberg, called the
<span class='it'>Sampson</span>, is said to be twenty three hundred feet
deep, and the town is inhabited entirely by the workmen.
I have since regretted that I did not spend a
day there in visiting these remarkable subterranean
works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town is built near the summit of the mountain
and commands a singularly wild and dreary view
over that part of the Hartz district. Bleak hills, on
which the snow still lay in patches, rose on every
side, and the valleys they enclosed looked dim and
gloomy in the distance. The Brocken was before
me, but its top, fifteen miles off, was covered with
clouds. I pushed on, hoping to reach it before night,
but while I was tracing the course of the canal which
carries water from the dammed mountain springs to
the mines, the air grew dense and damp, and a
wreath of cloud, trailing like a scarf along the cliffs
far below me, portended that night and storm were
coming together. When I reached the dam, on the
side of the Brocken, it began to rain dismally. The
wind whistled through the long dead grass and
soughed in the wet pines with a monotonous sound.
No sign of house or human being was visible, but I
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
kept on till twilight, when I reached a large solitary
building standing by the road. It was inhabited by
some forest superintendent or other functionary, and
is the second highest dwelling in the Hartz. As the
office of landlord was also included in the occupant’s
duties, I determined at once to spend the night there.
The only residents were the landlord and his wife,
two servants and a young man of polished manners,
yet of quiet and reserved appearance, who seemed
to be living there as much for the solitude of the
place as any other cause. After supper he was
more communicative, and by drawings and descriptions
gave me a very good idea of the remaining
eight miles to the summit of the Brocken, which I
was to try alone on the morrow. All night the
winds howled around the house as if all the witches
were abroad. It was the second of May, the night
after their yearly conclave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have related elsewhere my ascent through snow-drifts
and snow-clouds—up rocky ravines and over
mountain marshes—till I reached the Brocken House
drowned with rain, a most <a id='look'></a>woful-looking traveler.
After drying beside a stove like a furnace, and a
dinner which sent the blood warm and tingling through
my limbs, I put the Brocken-nosegay of moss and
lichens in my knapsack and passing the witches’
cauldron, took the path for Schierke. It led down
the southern side of the mountain, and the Brocken
host (Herr Nese, who for fifty years past has introduced
his Spectre to poets, peasants, philosophers
and princes) showed me a pile of rocks just under the
summit, where a few weeks before, his dogs had
found a handwerker buried in a snow-drift and on
the point of perishing. A half-hour’s walk brought
me below the region of snow, but not that of rain,
for the clouds were gathered over the mountains to
the right. As I reached the first forests they rolled
up black and swift and the drops began to fall hard
and heavily. Observing a little thicket of scrubby
pines, I lay down on the ground and crawled under
it, where I coiled myself up in the close and fragrant
covert, just as the floodgates were opened. A perfect
deluge succeeded; the trees roared and battled in the
wind; the gullies on either side were full of foaming
water and the air was nearly as dark as night. But
scarcely a drop found its way through my shelter. I
lay there warm and snug in the midst of a wild and
dreary storm, and never shall I forget my exquisite
sense of happiness while it lasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before sunset I came out upon a slope of rich
green pasture where several boys were tending a
flock of cattle. The sky was then partially clear
but cold, and as I was anxious to reach a village before
dark, I left the road to ask them my nearest way.
One question succeeded another, and having told
them to what country I belonged, I must needs stay
with them awhile and tell them about it. We sat on
a rock and talked until the shadow of the opposite
mountain fell over us, when I left them. They had
friends in America, and one of them thought he might
visit them when he grew older.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They delayed me so long that the foot-path I had
taken, through a deep and rocky hollow, was very
gloomy, and in the dim light, almost fearful. Vast
masses of rock clung to the side of the mountain,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Even as a wretched soul, hour after hour,</p>
<p class='line0'>Clings to the mass of life, yet clinging, leans;</p>
<p class='line0'>And leaning, makes more dark the dread abyss</p>
<p class='line0'>In which it fears to fall;”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>over and through the crevices were twisted the bony
roots of the pines, and down in the chasms I heard
the foaming of the swollen streams. This is the
path by which Faust and Mephistopheles ascended
the Brocken, and the storm which heralded my descent
into it reminded me of Goethe’s description:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“The night with mist is thick and black;</p>
<p class='line0'>Hark, how the forests roar and crack!</p>
<p class='line0'>The hooting owls affrighted fly.</p>
<p class='line0'>Shivered full the columns tall</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the palaces of pine.</p>
<p class='line0'>See the uniting boughs entwine—</p>
<p class='line0'>The mighty trunks that bend and groan—</p>
<p class='line0'>The hard roots grating on the stone!</p>
<p class='line0'>Mingling confusedly and madly, all</p>
<p class='line0'>Over each other are heaped in the fall,</p>
<p class='line0'>And around the crags, so wet and foul,</p>
<p class='line0'>The winds in fury hiss and howl!”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I thought of this ghostly passage and remembered
the caution given me by the old herdsman. But no
wrinkled hag, coursing on her he-goat the haunted
paths of the Brocken interrupted my progress, and
the cheerful lights of Elbingerode soon glimmered
through the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day I set out for the Rosstrappe, but
again went astray and came to a village on the river
Bode, deep down under steep mountains and the
abode of miners. The people told me of two noted
caves within half an hour’s walk, but the rain had
again set in, and I hastened forward toward the
Rosstrappe, the greatest wonder of the Hartz. The
scenery was no longer so lonely and exciting in its
character. Open, upland plains, with occasional
forests, skirted the road, and the men and women
at work in their scanty fields and gardens saluted me
with many a shout of laughter as I trudged along
through the wood. Roads branched off in all directions
from the main one, and left to my own judgment
as to the proper course, I continued on till I
reached the river, and saw a little hamlet on its
banks. At the only inn—a hut with two rooms—an
old grandam told me I had missed the way. The
Rosstrappe was two hours distant, and I could not
find it without a guide. The men were all away in
the woods, but a neighbor of hers would go with me
if I would give her a few groschen. To this I willingly
consented, and the kind old woman dried my
blouse carefully by the fire and brought me a dinner
of bread and milk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner the neighbor made her appearance,
with a large empty basket and announced herself
ready to start. My landlady rolled up in a paper a
large slice of bread and thrust it into my pocket,
charging me two groschen (6 cents) for my dinner.
I was about to shoulder my knapsack, when my
guide asked for it, saying she had brought her basket
on purpose for it. I hesitated at first; the thought of
walking unencumbered, with a woman carrying my
baggage seemed unchivalric, to say the least. I
made a rapid comparison between my weakness and
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
fatigue and the distance still to be traversed, and
decided by placing the knapsack in her basket and
assisting her to lift it upon her head. Off we went,
under a clear sky, for the first time since I entered
the Hartz. Through fine open forests and along precipices
overhanging the Bode—past the hunting-grounds
of the Dukes of Brunswick and across dells
fragrant with spring flowers—so we walked, for
nearly two hours, till the cottage-inn of the Rosstrappe
was visible through a vista of trees. Here I
took the knapsack and dismissed my guide with a
ten-groschen-piece, which I had been told was the
usual fee. It was evidently much more than she
expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I had seen the Rosstrappe, and hung over
the fearful chasm where the Bode thunders and foams
seven hundred feet below, not forgetting to note the
marvelous giant hoof-mark in the rock, I went back
to the inn. The landlady gave me the whole story
of the Rosstrappe while she brought and uncorked
a bottle of <span class='it'>birkensaft</span> or birch sap, for which the
Hartz is celebrated. This beverage, which is made
in no other part of the world, consists of the sap of
the birch tree, sweetened and suffered to ferment
slightly. It is of a bright pink color and delicious
taste. I had the table brought to the door, where I
could see the savage defile below, while the landlady
seated herself opposite with her knitting and gave
her tongue full play. Such a tongue! the words
came in an everlasting stream, and the faster she
talked the harder she knit; so that one yarn kept
pace with the other, and my visit increased the growth
of her stocking considerably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was once a pack of wild students here,”
said she, among the other marvelous stories she
related; “though all students are wild enough, as is
quite natural; but these fellows (I remember every
one of them) made a terrible noise all afternoon, with
their songs and their wine-bottles, and what not.
They climbed down the rocks to the Bode and up
again, and I must needs tell them the story of the
Rosstrappe twice over. When night came they
were still here under the trees, drinking, and as it
began to rain and they were not able to find their
way, the dear Lord knows, what was to be done but
keep them? We have no rooms for so many here,
you see; so I told them to take this chamber where
we are sitting and sleep as they best might. But
no sleep had I nor my good man; there was nothing
but singing and yelling the whole night. About midnight
there was a terrible rap on my door. ‘Himmel!’
I cried, ‘what is the matter?’ and I started up in
great fright. ‘O mein Gott!’ said one of the students,
‘there are wolves at the door.’ Now there
never was a wolf near the house, but I feared it
might be a spirit, or something as frightful, so I put
on my gown as quick as I could and lit my lamp, for
they had overturned theirs in their fright. When I
came into the room I found them all in one corner,
looking very wild and pale. ‘There are no wolves
here,’ said I. Just then a night-owl among the trees
began to hoot. ‘There it is, there it is again!’ they
cried, but I laughed, although I was very angry, to
be called up for an owl. ‘Go to sleep, you fools!’
I said to them, ‘do you not know better than to be
frightened by a <span class='it'>hoo-hoo</span>!’ The next morning they
were very much ashamed, as they truly might be,
for I tell about their fright to every body who comes
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Rosstrappe, I had reached the eastern extremity
of the Hartz, and after I descended the mountain
my way was enlivened by bloomy orchards and
springing grain. At sunset I was so far out in the
plain of the Elbe that I could see the snowy top of
the Brocken, free from clouds. This was my last
view of the bleak and spectral mountain. After a
night of terror at Halberstadt, (an account of which
the reader will find in my narrative of travel,) I took
the cars for Leipsic, which I reached the next night,
and where I found a companion waiting for me. So
ended my Lonely Week of Travel in Northern
Germany.</p>

<p class='line'>Oh! the bright and sunny days that long, long since were ours,</p>

<p class='line'>The sweet approving smile—the low, soft gentle tone,</p>
<p class='line'>With its murmured words of love, are they forever flown?</p>
<p class='line'>And from thy heart are banished all memories of me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t think I ever really loved but once; fancies
I have had, and fond ones, too; but now when the
cold, gray twilight of age is dimming the visions of
the past, memory still recalls, with wonderful power,
one bright face from the fair picture gallery of my
early loves—the face of Edla Fane, the schoolmaster’s
daughter. Beautiful she was not, and yet I
loved her, as I learned too late. She seemed to bind
me by some spell of witchery that I could not withstand,
and yet against which I rebelled, because it
appealed not to my outer senses. I understand it
now; she bound me by the might of a lofty, spiritual
love; and I blindly cast aside that gem of countless
price to grasp the dross of earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>High-toned, and pure-minded, tender, and confiding
as a child, yet with a sweet womanly pride,
and withal a dash of quiet humor, Edla Fane kept
me vacillating near her for a many months. At one
time feeling as though I could fall at her feet and
worship her, at another fearing I had expressed too
much, and withdrawing in cold reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening a cold mood came over me; I feared
I had committed myself in my ardent protestations
to Edla, and now spoke with the calmness of friendship
or platonic affection. She listened with a slight
curve of her expressive lip, and assented to my
proposal of affectionate friendship so readily, that
my self-love was aroused, and with characteristic
variableness my feelings gained immediate force
again. But Edla remained unmoved. The next day
I received the following lines in a blank <a id='enve'></a>envelope.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>[SEE ENGRAVING.]</p>

<p class='pindent'>We present our readers with an engraving of the
birth-place of the celebrated American painter, Benjamin
West, from an original drawing made by Mr.
Croome, in the year 1845. The house is situated in
the township of Springfield, Pennsylvania, about
four miles north of Chester, on a considerable farm
belonging to Mr. Peter Stewart. It will be perceived
that the house is in rather a dilapidated condition,
one of the posts of the portico being deficient. The
house is substantially built of brick, and, at the time
of its erection, must have been considered rather an
elegant country residence; but its antiquity and state
of decay will probably prevent any future attempt to
put it in repair. The spot, however, will always be
interesting to Americans, from its having been the
scene of West’s childhood, to which are referred
those delightful and well known anecdotes, of his
early life, which display the dawnings of that brilliant
genius which was destined to astonish the
world by its achievements in the graphic art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of our revolutionary history immediately
succeeding the defeat at Camden, is still remembered
in the Carolinas with horror. The British,
elated with their success, and regarding the South
as now their own, proceeded in the work of confiscation
and massacre with pitiless severity. In that
terrible crisis many a family was deprived of its
head either by exile or by execution. Yet larger
numbers were shorn of their property and reduced to
comparative indigence. In a word, terror reigned
paramount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the common events of life still went on. The
transactions of business, the struggle for wealth, the
toils of the husbandman, births, deaths, marriages,
cares, hopes, fears—all followed each other down the
deep current of existence, almost wholly unaffected
by the storm of war which agitated the surface. It
is an error to suppose that great convulsions disturb
the whole order of society. Men will still hate,
though the entire nation be turned into a camp; will
still strive for the dross of earth; will still, if young
and generous, risk their heart’s happiness in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was toward the close of a winter evening that
a youth of noble mien and handsome face stood at
the foot of one of those long avenues of trees, which,
in South Carolina, lead up from the road to the
mansions of the wealthier proprietors. For nearly
half an hour he had been there, as if awaiting the
approach of some one from the house: now looking
anxiously up the long avenue, now restlessly walking
to and fro. During that interval but one person
had passed along the highway, and the notice of this
one the youth had skillfully avoided by concealing
himself behind some dwarf trees within the plantation-fence.
This act, as well as his whole demeanor,
proved that he was awaiting some secret interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, just when the dusk began to deepen into
night, the flutter of a white dress was seen coming
down the avenue. A minute more, and a beautiful
girl of eighteen summers appeared on the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Albert,” said the new comer, as the youth, seizing
her hand, passionately kissed it, “I have not a
second to stay. It was with difficulty I could leave
the house unseen, and my absence has doubtless
been noticed before this; what we have to say, therefore,
must be said at once; why have you sought
this interview?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sought it, Ellen,” he replied, still holding
her hand, “because, despairing of gaining your
consent, I have volunteered in Capt. Washington’s
cavalry corps, and to-morrow set forth. Perhaps
you will never see me more. I could not leave the
neighborhood without seeing you once more, and
bidding you an eternal farewell; and, as your father’s
orders had banished me from the house, there was
no method of giving you my adieux except by soliciting
an interview.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears had started to the eyes of his listener, but
she turned away her head to conceal them; and for
some time neither spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen, dear Ellen,” said the young soldier,
earnestly, “will you not now, in this solemn moment,
say you love me? I once hoped you did, but
since your father has forbidden me the house, you
have been less kind; and I fear that I have lost your
heart—that you, too, have ceased to care for me,
now that I am beggared—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hearer suddenly turned her face full upon him,
with a look of tearful reproach that cut short his
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, Ellen, for that look,” he said. “Though
my father’s estate is confiscated, and he and I both
indigent, it is not on that account that you have
seemed so cold to me lately. Say then, dearest, only
say that I have been mistaken in thinking you at all
altered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another look, equally eloquent, answered him;
but still his hearer did not speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Ellen,” he continued, “when I am far
away fighting my country’s battles, what bliss it
would be to know that you sometimes think of me;
and that if I should fall, you would shed a tear for
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His listener, at these words, wept freely, and when
her agitation had somewhat passed, spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Albert,” she said, “you have conquered. Know
then that I do love you.” At these words the impetuous
young man clasped her in his arms, but she
disengaged herself, saying, “But, while my father
opposes your suit, I can never be yours. The
consciousness of his disapproval has made me affect
a coldness to you which my heart belied, in the
hope that you would think of some one more worthy
of you—but—but,” she hesitated, then quickly added,
“in a word, if it will comfort you, when away, to
know that I think of you, and pray for you, go forth
happy—the misery is for us who stay behind, and
who are hourly anxious for the fate of the absent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears fell fast as she spoke, and, concluding,
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>
she suffered her head to be drawn to her lover’s
shoulder, while a deep and holy silence succeeded,
as these two young and already unhappy beings held
each other in a first embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only for a moment, however, that Ellen
yielded to weakness. Raising her head and brushing
the tears from her eyes, she said, while crimson
blushes overspread her face,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now farewell—perhaps all this is wrong—but
I could not see you leave me in anger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you for those kind words,” said
Albert. “But, Ellen, before you go, one more request.
That miniature that hangs around your neck—is
it too much to ask for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated: then, as steps were heard in the
road, suddenly gave it to him. He drew a heavy
signet-ring from his finger, and said, tendering it in
exchange,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take this, and let us be true to each other—so
help us God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with this parting adjuration, he sprang over
the fence to conceal himself behind the brushwood,
while Ellen, hastening up the avenue, was soon lost
to sight in the obscurity of the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind sighed mournfully through the pine woods
as this betrothal was consummated, and the dark,
starless sky overhead looked down with its weird
and melancholy face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is well known that, after the defeat of Gates,
Congress hastened to supersede that general, and
appoint Greene to succeed him. At the period of the
incidents narrated in the last chapter, the new commander-in-chief
had arrived in the South, and was
organizing his forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His very first proceeding showed the resources of
an intellect, which, in military affairs, was second
only to that of the “father of his country.” Aware
that the initiatory step toward redeeming the South
was to arouse the confidence of its people, he determined
to divide his force. While, therefore, he
moved with one portion down the Pedee, he despatched
Morgan, with the remainder, west of the
Catawba, in order to encourage the inhabitants in
that quarter. Morgan’s corps was accompanied by
Capt. Washington’s light dragoons, of which our
hero had already become a conspicuous member.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This division of his army, in the face of an active
foe, would have been a capital error, but for the
political advantages it offered, and which over-balanced
the military ones. Cornwallis, then in
command of the royal army, determined to frustrate
the success of Greene’s plan, by cutting off Morgan’s
detachment; and accordingly ordered Col. Tarleton,
with his renowned dragoons, accompanied by a competent
force of infantry, to give pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the 14th of January, 1781, a day ever to be
remembered in the annals of our country, that the
heroic Morgan learned the danger in which he stood.
He determined immediately to give battle. For this
purpose he halted at a place called the Cowpens, and
having drawn up his troops, awaited, though not
without anxiety, the appearance of the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attack of Tarleton, as usual, was impetuous,
and for awhile the American militia were driven
helplessly before it; but soon they rallied, under
cover of a few continentals belonging to Morgan’s
command, and in turn forced the British to give
ground. These brave soldiers of the line, led by
their colonel, now charged with the bayonet, when
the route of the royal infantry became complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington, with his cavalry, had been waiting
impatiently a chance to participate in the fight; but
having been stationed as a partial reserve, the order
for him to engage did not for some time arrive. His
troops shared his enthusiasm. Composed chiefly of
young men of family, and mounted on thorough-bred
animals, they presented a formidable appearance,
as they stood, awaiting the order to engage, the
horses champing at the bit, and the riders nervously
fingering their swords: they saw the onset of the
British, the flight of the first line, and the partial
panic that extended through the foot soldiers with
horror; but still their leader remained unmoved. Many
had never been in battle before, and such believed
the day lost; among these was Albert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the confusion became so great around them
that troops so undisciplined, if less brave, would
have taken to ignominious flight; for the defeated
militia were pouring down upon them from all sides,
almost compelling them to break their ranks, or see
the fugitives perish under the hoofs of their horses.
But now Washington seemed to rouse from his inaction.
Ordering his men first to allow the flying
militia to gain their rear, he then directed them, his
sharp, quick tones showing that the moment for action
had come, to close up and prepare to charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, he pointed with his sword ahead,
and our hero beheld the renowned regiment of
Tarleton coming down upon them at full gallop, and
amid a cloud of dust, driving before a mass of dismayed
fugitives. The keen eye of Washington
measured, for an instant, the distance between them,
and then said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want no fire-arms used to-day, my lads. Stick
to the cold steel. And now, for God and your
country—charge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away went the troop, like a thunder-bolt suddenly
loosed from a cloud, with every scabbard jingling,
every steed snorting with excitement, and the
solid earth shaking under them. In full career they
burst upon the flank of the enemy, who, disordered
by his pursuit, could make but a feeble resistance.
Horse and rider went down before the impetuous
charge of the Americans, who for awhile fairly rode
down their foes. But British valor soon proved too
weak for the combined patriotism and courage of
Washington’s cavalry; and the royal troops, taming
their bridles, took to ignominious flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On, on,” cried Washington, waving his sword
for his men to follow, “remember the cruelties of
these myrmidons. Revenge for our slaughtered
countrymen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
At the word, his men, thus reminded of the
butchery of the Waxhaws and of the other atrocities
perpetrated under the eye of Tarleton, spurred their
horses afresh, and dashed on in pursuit. A complete
panic had now taken possession of the royal
cavalry, who hurried on at full gallop, each man
thinking only of himself. Close on their heels followed
the indignant Americans, cutting down mercilessly
every red-coat they overtook, until the road
was strewed with the dead. Foremost in this pursuit
rode Washington, a precedence he owed, not
only to his superior steed, but to his eagerness to
overtake an officer just ahead, whom he judged
to be Tarleton himself from his effort to rally the
fugitives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tremendous pace at which Washington rode,
at last carried him so far ahead of his men, that, at a
bend in the highway, he found himself totally alone.
At this moment, the British, looking back, perceived
his situation, and immediately turned on him, his
principal assailants being Tarleton and two powerful
dragoons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowing, however, that assistance must be close
at hand, Washington resolutely advanced to meet
the enemy, determined to seize Tarleton for his
prisoner. But, before he could reach the colonel,
the two dragoons dashed at him, the one on the right,
the other on the left. He saw only the first of them,
however, and accordingly turned on him, clove him
down with a single blow of his sabre, then rushed at
Tarleton himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, meantime, the other dragoon was advancing,
totally disregarded, upon him, and with upraised blade
would have cut him down, had not our hero, who had
pressed close after his leader, at this instant wheeled
round the corner of the wood. At a single glance
he took in the whole scene. Albert saw that before
he could come up Washington would be slain, unless
fire-arms were employed. In this emergency he
did not hesitate to disobey the orders of his leader.
Jerking a pistol from his holster, he aimed full at the
dragoon, just as the sabre of the latter was sweeping
down on Washington’s head. The man tumbled
headlong from his saddle, his sword burying itself,
in the dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! who is that?” said Washington, sternly, so
astonished to find his orders disobeyed, that he turned;
a movement which Tarleton took advantage of to
make good his escape. “You, Albert!—you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was no other way,” answered our hero,
and he pointed to the dead dragoon, “to save your
life. His sabre was within six inches of you when
I fired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It could not be helped, then, I suppose,” answered
Washington, who now comprehended the event, and
saw that he owed his life to the quickness of thought
of his young friend; “but stay, you are yourself
hurt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, he saw blood issuing from the sleeve
of Albert, and immediately afterward the young
soldier reeled and fell senseless to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two pistol shots had been discharged from the
enemy, Washington now recollected, immediately
after Albert had fired. On examination, one ball was
found in the arm of our hero. The other had perforated
the coat, immediately over the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is dead,” cried the leader, “that second shot
has touched a vital part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tore away the garments as he spoke, but uttered
a cry of joy when he exposed the chest, for there,
right over the heart, lay a miniature, which had
stopped the ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Washington looked at the picture, and muttered,
“Ha! I have heard of this—and now I will see if I
cannot serve my young friend a good turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When our hero, after a long interval of unconsciousness,
opened his eyes, he found himself, to his
surprise, in a large and elegantly furnished apartment,
entirely strange to him. He pulled aside the
curtains of his bed with his uninjured arm, and looked
out. An aged female servant sat watching him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What massa want?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did I get here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Washington heself left you here, massa,
after de great battle. De surgeon staid to dress your

<p class='pindent'>“It hab, massa; and you be to stay here till you
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old negro woman smiled till she showed all
her teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You no know, massa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forgit me, Massa Albert—me, Missus Ellen’s
maman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” cried our hero, scarcely believing
his senses, and scrutinizing her features, “can it be?
You are indeed she. And this is Mr. Thorndike’s
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had started up in bed, and was now confronted
by the figure of the owner of the mansion himself,
who entered at an opposite door; but who, instead
of wearing the angry air which Albert had last seen
upon him, smiled kindly upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was passing along the corridor,” he said, seating
himself on the bedside familiarly, and taking the
hand of his wounded guest, “and hearing your voice,
learned for the first time that you were awake. Accordingly
I made bold to enter, in order to assure
you of a welcome. When we last parted, Mr. Scott,”
he said, noticing our hero’s look of astonishment,
“it was with ill-feeling on both sides. Let all that
be forgotten. Whatever I may have said then I
now recall. In saving the life of Capt. Washington,
who is my dearest friend, you have laid me under
infinite obligations, and at his request I have consented
to overlook the past, and to give you my
daughter. I only make a single stipulation, which
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
is that you will not ask her hand until this war is
over, which,” he added, lowering his voice, “can
not be long, now that things have begun to go so
auspiciously.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero well understood the character of Mr.
Thorndike, who was noted for his prudent adherence
to whichever side was uppermost, and he attributed
this sudden change not only to Capt. Washington’s
intercessions, but also in part to the prospect there
now was of the triumph of the colonial cause, in
which case the confiscated estates of the elder Mr.
Scott would be restored. He kept this to himself,
however, and expressed his thanks for Mr. Thorndike’s
hospitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall owe you even more,” he added, “for
the happiness with which your promise has filled me,
and I cheerfully accept your terms. Meantime, let
me rise, and pay my respects to the ladies in person—I
am sure I am well enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our hero, however, was compelled to keep his
bed for two entire days, in consequence of the fever,
a period which appeared to him an age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall not attempt to describe his meeting with
Ellen. Let us pass over the first few minutes of the
interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but one thing to regret,” he said at last,
in a low whisper, for Mr. and Mrs. Thorndike were
at the other end of the apartment, “and that is the
loss of your miniature. I had it around my neck
when I went into battle, but have not seen it since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellen smiled archly, and drew it from her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did it reach your possession?” he said in
surprise. And, taking it in his hand, he added,
“What means this dent, so like the mark of a ball?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears gushed to Ellen’s eyes, as she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Capt. Washington, who gave it to me, said that
it lay over your heart, and that but for it, Tarleton’s
pistol-shot would have killed you. Oh! Albert, I
sometimes thought, after I gave it to you, that I had
done wrong, knowing that my parents would not
approve of the act; but when I heard that it had
saved your life, I saw in it the hand of Providence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! for it not only preserved me from death,
but was the means of interesting Washington in our
favor, and thus bringing about this happy re-union,”
said Albert, after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no more to tell. On recovering from
his wound, our hero rejoined his corps, with which
he continued until the expulsion of the British from
the Carolinas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that happy event he was married to Ellen,
and with her spent a long life of felicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their descendants still preserve the battered miniature
as an heir-loom.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_17'>MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This species is widely spread over the United
States, Mexico and the West Indies. Trappers have
found it in abundance amid the wild solitudes of
Oregon and the gorges of the Rocky Mountains.
The great body of these birds winter within the
tropics, from whence they reach the Southern States
early in spring, and Pennsylvania in April. They
begin to build in May, choosing for this purpose
either the thickest parts of the forest or a low
meadow, retired from the intrusion of man. The
nest is constructed of dry leaves and grass, and
always concealed by thick grass, heaps of brush or
other undergrowth. Indeed few of our songsters are
more shy or modest than the Yellow-Throat, and he
seems to be devoid of the apparent vanity evinced
by most birds of handsome or gaudy plumage. The
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
lonely banks of a small stream, overgrown with
reeds and bushes, is his favorite haunt; and here,
with his sober mate, he whiles away the long sultry
days of our summer’s heat. The eggs are five in
number, either entirely white or of a pale pink tint,
varied by minute specks and lines, mostly toward
the greater end. After being hatched, which occurs
in June, the young birds join the parent pair, and all
live as one family, roving along creeks and marshes,
and defending each other from enemies. Sometimes,
however, a second brood interrupts this connection.
In August the lively song of the male ceases to be
heard, and the whole party continue their pursuits in
silence until warned by a scarcity of food to depart
for the South.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Maryland Yellow-Throat is nearly five inches
long, and more than six across the spread wings.
The upper parts are a light olive; the throat and
breast yellow; the wings and tail brown, mixed
with black; the legs are pale flesh-color, and remarkable
for their delicacy. The young resemble
the female at first, but the male of the season, before
his departure in autumn, exhibits the brilliant yellow
throat, as well as some appearance of the gray and
black which ornament the sides of the face in the
adult. Small insects form the almost exclusive prey
of this bird, and in capturing them he often displays
much art and agility. His song is a plaintive whistle,
varying in power and cadence, and sometimes associated
with partial imitations of other birds. In
September, small flocks depart for the South, only a
few stragglers being seen after that month. A few
pass the winter in the Southern States, but as already
stated, the greater portion retire within the Tropics.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_18'>SUMMER YELLOW-BIRD, OR WARBLER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Few birds are more common, or more widely
spread than this well known species. According to
Richardson, it is found as far north as the 68th degree
of latitude, from whence it ranges throughout the
entire North American continent, the West Indies,
Bahamas, Colombia, Peru, Guiana, Brazil and other
portions of South America. These latter countries
are their winter residence. In the early part of
March they arrive in Carolina, and two months later
in Pennsylvania, New England, etc. Here they pass
the summer, and leave for the South about the beginning
of September, the time of departure varying
with the season and latitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Yellow-Bird is a general favorite with the
farmer. In summer he may be seen upon almost
every tree, but especially among the willows along
water-courses, where his brilliant plumage forms a
fine relief with the deep glossy green. Being familiar
and playful, he often approaches so near as to
be captured. His favorite food is larvæ and small
caterpillars, which he searches for with much industry,
enlivening the hardship of his labor by a cheerful
whistle or song. About the time of building, and
even after, the female sings almost as well as the
male. Both these birds display great ingenuity and
solicitude in the construction of their nest, which is
usually placed on a small bush close to the ground.
Instances are rare where they build on the ground
or on a high tree. The nest is constructed externally
of dried leaves, fine bark and fern, and within of
down, wool, fine grass, and similar materials. Occasionally
they forsake the woods, and build in the
hedge or bushes of the garden, suiting the construction
of their small home to the change of residence.
“The labor of forming the nest,” as Nuttall observes,
“seems often wholly to devolve on the female. On
the 10th of May, I observed one of these industrious
matrons busily engaged with her fabric in a low
barberry-bush, and by the evening of the second day
the whole was completed to the lining, which was
made at length of hair and willow down, of which
she collected and carried mouthfuls so large, that she
often appeared almost like a mass of flying cotton,
and far exceeded in industry her active neighbor, the
Baltimore, who was also engaged in collecting the
same materials. Notwithstanding this industry, the
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
completion of the nest, with this and other small
birds, is sometimes strangely protracted, or not immediately
required.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eggs of the Yellow-Bird are four or five in
number, white, with small spots of brown. After
they are hatched, or even while sitting, the female
often feigns lameness at the approach of a stranger,
falling down near him and uttering pitiful cries, or
perhaps fluttering along the ground. It is frequently
annoyed by the intrusions of the Cow Troupial, which,
building no nest of her own, makes use of the
Yellow-Bird’s. The little builder being too weak to
remove the incumbrance, generally builds a partition
over it, thus preventing its being hatched. Nests
have been found in which a second story has been
raised in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Yellow-Bird is five inches long, and seven
across the wings. Greenish yellow above; below,
with crown and front golden, and orange spots on
the breast; wings and tail brown, and the bill blue.
The female is without any variation of color on the
breast.</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_19'>BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Green Warbler arrives in Pennsylvania about
the beginning of May, and in New England somewhat
later. When observed for the first time in
spring, it is generally alone, seated on a fruit-tree,
and industriously searching for the small insects and
larvæ which constitute his food. The species is
somewhat rare, rarely more than a single pair, as it
is asserted, being seen together, except in the fall,
when scattered individuals collect to prepare for
migration. Except during the period of incubation,
they are not very shy of man, often permitting him
to approach within a few feet. They are supposed
to wander in summer as far north as Canada and
Hudson’s Bay, but the larger portion remain in the
Middle and New England States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little is known of the precise time of building,
since the habits of this songster are then retired.
They appear to prefer low, dry situations, and build
on bushes, not far from the ground. A nest examined
by Nuttall contained four eggs, of a light flesh-colored
tint, variegated with pale, purplish points of
various sizes, interspersed with other large, brown
or blackish spots. The outside was formed of fine
strips of the inner bark of juniper, with another
tough, fibrous bark, the whole lined with soft
feathers, horse hair, and bent grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Green Warbler is four and a half inches in
length, and seven across the wings. The chin and
throat are black, with spots of the same color on the
sides under the wings. The breast and belly are
white, the wings and tail dusky, with some white,
and the legs and feet pale brown. A bird called
by Latham and Pennant the Yellow-Fronted Warbler,
is probably but a variation of the same species.
The song of the Green Warbler is a somewhat plaintive
note, not unlike that of the Chicadee, uttered at
short intervals, in a slow manner and with some
variation. Owing to its solitary habits, it rarely
mingles in the chorus of our summer groves.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Selections from the Writings of James Kennard, Jr. With a
Sketch of His Life and Character. Boston: Wm. D.
Ticknor &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is printed for private circulation, and we
should not have thought of making it the subject of a notice,
were it not for the interest which attaches to the
name of the author. Mr. Kennard was stricken early in
life with a disease in his knee—was compelled, at the age
of twenty-two, to have his leg amputated—and from that
time to his death, ten years after, he was afflicted with a
series of diseases, frightfully accumulating one upon another,
which at last deprived him of all power of motion,
and sparing not even his eyes. Yet though thus seemingly
cut off from all enjoyments, and doomed to the
peevishness as well as the pain of the sick chamber, he
bravely surmounted by force of will the mental effects of
his ailments, and developed in physical agony and deprivation
one of the most beautiful and loveable characters
we have had the fortune to meet in literature or in life.
Serene, cheerful, hopeful, affectionate—uncomplaining in
the midst of miseries, any one of which might well have
quelled a strong spirit, and which, combined, seemed impossible
for any spirit to bear—he not only was a genial
companion, ready to talk of every thing but his own pains
and deprivations, but a voluminous writer. The present
volume, consisting of essays, reviews and poems, contributed
to the Knickerbocker, the Christian Examiner, and
various newspapers and periodicals, indicates not merely
the degree of excellence to which by self-culture he had
trained his talents for composition, but also the wide
range of his studies, and the wider range of his sympathies.
For every holy and beneficent enterprise started
to alleviate the miseries of the unfortunate, to assist the
poor and the ignorant, or to champion the oppressed, this
self-forgetful valetudinary had a word of cheer warm
from his heart. There is also a sunny, almost frolicksome
and dancing, spirit of enjoyment in many of his pieces,
which is usually <a id='char'></a>characteristic only of the highest physical
health. The article on our “National Poets” is especially
teeming with the very exuberance of fun. That on
Alison’s History of Europe is one of the most judicious
and brilliant papers on the subject published on either side
of the Atlantic. Indeed the whole book preaches on every
page the most scorching rebukes to indolent and self-indulgent
health, and the most inspiring hope to despairing
sickness. The reading of such a book, in connection
with the character of such a man, is enough to create
courage, and cheer under the very “ribs of death.”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Mardi, and a Voyage Thither. By Herman Melville. New
York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Melville has given us here an acknowledged romance,
and those who doubted the veracity of “Typee”
and “Omoo,” may now have an opportunity of noticing
the difference between Mr. Melville recording what he
has observed, and Mr. Melville recording what he has
imagined. It appears to us that the two processes in the
author’s mind have little in common, and the best evidence
of the truthfulness of his former books is the decidedly
romantic character of much of the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mardi” is altogether the most striking work which
Mr. Melville has produced, exhibiting a range of learning,
a fluency of fancy, and an originality of thought and diction,
of which “Typee,” with all its distinctness and
luxuriance of description, gave little evidence. At the
same time it has defects indicating that the author has not
yet reached the limits of his capacity, and that we may
hope from him works better even than the present.
“Mardi” is of the composite order of mental architecture,
and the various rich materials which constitute it are not
sufficiently harmonized to produce unity of effect. It has
chapters of description, sketches of character, flashes of
fanciful exaggeration, and capital audacities of satire,
which are inimitable, but confusion, rather than fusion,
characterizes the book as a whole. Of the two volumes
the first is by far the best, but both contain abundant evidence
of the richness, strength and independence of the
author’s mind, and are full of those magical touches which
indicate original genius.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Nineveh and Its Remains. With an Account of a Visit to
the Chaldean Christians of Kurdistan and the Yezidas, or
Devil-Worshipers; and an Inquiry into the Manners and
Arts of the Ancient Assyrians. By Austen Henry Layard,
Esq., D.C.L. New York: Geo. P. Putnam. 2 vols. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Private letters from England confirm the reports in the
public journals of the great sensation which this work has
excited in Great Britain. It divides with Macaulay’s
brilliant history the attention of the reading public. The
American publisher, with commendable enterprise, has
issued it in a style of great elegance, and has given all the
illustrative engravings which decorate the English edition.
The work, when we consider the expense of its mechanical
execution, is placed at a very low price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These volumes belong to a class of books which may be
called the geology of history—the exhibition of a nation’s
history and social life through its monuments. The greatest
work of this kind in English is doubtless Wilkinson’s
on the Ancient Egyptians, and the production of Mr.
Layard is next in rank. It introduces us to the Assyrians
through a process which enables us to comprehend their
material and mental life—to see them as they <a id='ate'></a>ate, dressed,
warred, thought and prayed. Their fine and useful arts,
their costume, their amusements, their military system,
their private life, their religion, are all brought directly
before the eye and mind of the reader, and he is enabled
to discern that peculiar combination of the elements of
human nature which constituted the Assyrian mind and
heart, and to reconcile the apparent anomalies in the national
character. The picture is one of engrossing interest,
and cannot fail to enlarge every mind which contemplates
it. It is almost needless to say that the course
Mr. Layard has pursued is the only possible mode by
which authentic information can be obtained of an extinct
people, who left no historical records, and who were
almost forgotten before history began. The illustrations
given in the work of the truth of many passages in the
Old Testament, are not the least interesting and remarkable
portions of a most interesting and striking book.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Gold Mines of the Gila. A Sequel to Old Hicks the
Guide. By Charles W. Webber. New York: Dewitt &amp;
Davenport. 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This work possesses a double interest; first, as a most
stirring and graphic delineation of life, character and
scenery on the borders of Texas, and second, as indicating
an almost unknown region of the Continent, rich in gold
mines and wealth of various kinds, and tempting both
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
curiosity and cupidity to its exploration. Mr. Webber
proposes to head an expedition of some sixty men, to be
called the “Centralia Exploring Expedition to California,
via the valleys of the Pecos, the Gila, and Colorado of
the West,” for the purpose of discovery and profit; and in
the course of this delightful book of adventure, he spreads
before his readers the evidence he possesses of the existence
of the region into which he desires to penetrate. If
his expedition succeed we have little doubt that it will be
one of the most interesting and romantic since the time of
Cortez; and the leader himself has qualities of valor,
endurance and chivalric sentiment, sufficient to carry him
through the difficulties of any enterprise, however arduous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from the information relating to a new gold region,
Mr. Webber’s volumes possess an engrossing interest
as records of adventure. The author has a sureness and
vividness of conception, and a power of expression, which
combined make his delineations singularly fresh and life-like.
To read this book is the next best thing to viewing
the objects it describes. It displays a representative
genius of a high order, and if the author would concentrate
his energies, he might produce a novel which would
give him a place in the front rank of our original minds.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Rural Letters and other Records of Thought at Leisure,
written in the intervals of more hurried Literary Labor.
By N. Parker Willis. New York: Baker &amp; Scribner.
1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The publication of this delightful volume was well-timed,
appearing as it did with the new grass and the first
flowers; and we doubt not it will be the companion of many
a city tourist during the summer months. It is, perhaps,
the most fascinating of Mr. Willis’s prose works, evincing
more than his usual graceful facility of expression and
fluency of thought, and variegated with the cosiest fancies
and most genial wit. The author shakes hands with
nature, and though the gleam of his jeweled fingers sometimes
suggests that he is merely a visiter to her dominions,
his beautiful audacity of manner forces the old lady to
tell him some of her finest secrets—secrets which she has
not always confided to her unconventional adorers. We
hardly know whether the book is more calculated to delight
the citizen or the countryman, but certainly there is
a sweet fusion of nature and convention in it which must
win the hearts of both. The volume contains “Letters
from Under a Bridge,” “Open-Air Musings in the City,”
“Invalid Rambles in Germany,” “Letters from Watering
Places,” and “A Plain Man’s Love.” It is dedicated to
Imogene, the author’s daughter, in five of the best pages
that Mr. Willis ever wrote. The book is elegantly
printed, and cannot but reach that wide circulation which
it so richly merits.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Philosophy of Religion. By J. Morell, A. M. New York:
D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of this valuable volume is one to task the
energies of the strongest intellect, and Mr. Morell seems
to have exerted his to its utmost capacity in its production.
Though it may not be in all cases sound and practical it
evinces a wide knowledge of philosophical systems, is
eminently suggestive, and thoroughly imbued with the
spirit both of philosophy and religion. Mr. Morell is a
metaphysician of the Scotch school, a follower of Reid
and Hamilton, and from the latter especially he has drawn
a good deal of his inspiration. Indeed, Sir William
Hamilton’s dissertations and notes annexed to the late
edition of Reid, are destined to have a wide if not a deep
influence on contemporary thought. The present volume
indicates how important are his distinctions of presentative
and representative knowledge, for from Hamilton’s
philosophy of perception a good portion of the book is
drawn. Mr. Morell is well adapted to popularize the
principles of more scientific and original thinkers than
himself, and we hardly know of two works better calculated
to initiate the reading public into the nature of the
problems which vex metaphysics and metaphysical theology
than his history of Philosophy and his present volume
on the Philosophy of Religion.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Les Confidences. Confidential Disclosures. By Alphonse
de Lamartine. Translated from the French, by Eugene
Plunket.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This curious volume is the commencement of an autobiography,
in which Lamartine confides to the public the
thoughts and events of his life. Like all the other productions
of the accomplished author it is written in a charming
style, and with an abundance of captivating sentiment, but
it gives no evidence of that robustness and solidity of nature
we are accustomed to expect in a great man after the
Saxon type. The sentimental dogmatist and egotist is
predominant throughout, and with all its merit it seems to
us one of those books which convey intellectual disease
into the public mind, and enfeeble while they please. It
would not, perhaps, be just to test its excellence by its
agreement with English or American codes of taste, or
object to some of its disclosures as puerile and unmanly,
because so stigmatized by the canons of a particular nation,
but we think on general principles of human nature
it cannot stand a sharp examination. There is no evidence
of any intrinsic greatness and grandeur of mind or
heart in the book, nothing which justifies the author in
making his weaknesses and vices, his virtues and fine notions,
the subject of a particular work, and cramming the
public mind with himself. There is really no addition
made to our knowledge of ethics or metaphysics, to society
or psychology, by the exhibition here made of the interior
nature of Alphonse de Lamartine. He “wears his heart
upon his sleeve” to no other purpose than to gratify a
ravenous vanity or to fill an empty purse—two of the
poorest objects a man can have in view in exhibiting
himself.</p>

treatise on the history and domestic economy of
the honey-bee, embracing a full illustration of the whole
subject, with the most approved method of managing
this insect through every branch of its culture. The
work is the result of many years careful notings of
personal observation and experience, and abounds in
agreeable as well as useful matter. It is a very readable
volume, and opens a pleasant leaf of knowledge to the
student of nature.</p>

the author’s first efforts—and very creditable they are.
The design of the poem is, to unite the discoveries of astronomical

<hr class='tbk144'/>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='h_20'>AN EARLY FLOWER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Last month direct reference was made by our contributors
to the beauties of May. Poets have felt the inspiration
of the season from the first, and all the beauties and
all the odors of the month have seemed transfused to their
verse, rich in metrical excellence, and redolent of the
sweets it embalmed. But we have taken a range among the
hills and valleys, and, unable to express in poetry those
sentiments which the season inspired, we must, though a
month later, appeal to humble prose, and make a record of
what we saw and felt, with no hope of suggesting high
thoughts to others, or of awakening that feeling which,
in the gifted and the good, may be aroused by eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chill of April winds does not prevent the greenness
of herbage which the fecundating power of April rains
provokes. And hidden in among the relics of last year’s
vegetation, and the nascent herbage of young spring,
little flowers had nestled away; little, but beautiful
flowers, decorating the narrow space between the new-born
child and the dead parent. I plucked a few of those
modest gems, almost afraid that I desecrated the altar of
Nature, in thus taking its scanty decorations; but they
did their office, since they awakened in me a remembrance
of Him whose hand planted the towering oak that makes
the forest majestic, and whose fingers scattered the seed
that produced these minute ministers of his will, these
records of his omnipotence and omnipresence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All things are full of God”—it is the language of the
heathen poet, it is the language of divine inspiration, it
is the language of the heart touched with the truths of Nature,
and connecting them with Nature’s Author. “Hill
and dale are of thy dressing.” And as I stood in the dale,
amid the delicate outpouring of the beauties there, and
looked upward to the hills studded with the time-marked
trees, I said to myself, “Here is that volume of truth that
speaks of the unknown, yet not unreverenced, God, whose
will and providence are revealed in the volume of inspiration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had, almost insensibly, got within the enclosure of a
burying-ground, which is situated near the Frankford
Road, only a few miles from the city, and was transferring
my thoughts from the beautiful objects of Nature to
the specimens of human ingenuity that transmit the date
of birth and death, with the name of the mortal, from one
generation to the other. No one, I believe, passes through
a burying-ground without pausing to read the little story,
and thinking over the events which marked the life of the
deceased. It is good when standing thus to think that he
who is below was of like passions with ourselves—that he
had all the social and domestic feelings which we possess,
and was influenced by the events of life as we are. What
a world do we animate when we thus think of each individual—thus
place him in connection with social, domestic,
political life. How we multiply interests, augment
joys, and increase the pangs to which human existence is
liable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the turning of one of the little avenues that “lead to
the tomb,” making an easy path to the grave, I saw that
a new head-stone had been erected, and it bore the name of
one whom I had known in her childhood. She was beautiful—but
more lovely in mind than person. She married
early, and gave birth to an infant, and died—a short
biography. She was not forgotten. The memorials testified
to the yet existing memory of her husband—and a
nurse leading a little child toward the mound signified that
her virtues were to be kept in remembrance by the child
she had borne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little flower had sprung up on the very top of the
grave. It had probably been planted in the autumn, but
it was now beautiful in its solitude. Its colors were as
rich as if the roots had struck down and drawn nutriment
from the heart that mouldered below, and its odors were
as rich as if they were imparted by the spirit that had
gone upward. I know not when I have seen thus placed
a more lovely flower; perhaps it owed a part of this estimate
to its loneliness, a part to its connection with the
beauty and purity of her over whom it expanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little child on leaning over the grave fell prostrate,
and manifested no disposition to rise. After a few moments
delay, I gently raised her in my arms, and placed
her on her feet. She seemed not pleased at first with my
interference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my mamma’s grave,” said she, with much emphasis,
“and she is down there now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But lying on that moist ground might expose you to
take cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I love to throw myself there,” she said. “I must
do it, for I loved her much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I tried to persuade her to desist, but she stepped toward
the grave with a view of repeating her fall. Her attendant
stooped down, and said in a low voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your dear mother would not be pleased to see you
do wrong, even if it was in token of your love for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will not do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If there had been no good seed planted in the child’s
heart, at least the soil had been beautifully prepared for
the planting—what could have been better done than this
reverence for the name and virtues of a mother, and this
obedience to her supposed will? I had, I thought, lighted
on another truly lovely spring flower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you come often to visit your mother’s grave?”
I asked of the little one. The child looked up as if the
inquiry should be repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We make frequent visits hither,” said the attendant.
“We come almost daily in good weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes!” said the child, “we come every fine day
to visit where mother lies—and I am not afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you fear?” said I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child looked confused at the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will some day <span class='it'>meet</span> your mother if you are constant
in your love, and thus seek to do whatever your
friends tell you she would have desired, and to avoid what
she would not have approved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will endeavor to do so—but—I shall not meet her—we
are going to Europe again, and shall not return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Europe—but, my child, God is everywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir; but my mother is not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear child, your mother’s spirit, her soul, that
which is loved in your mother, is, I hope, in Heaven; it is
not in the grave to moulder into dust—the body takes that
course, but the spirit returns to God who gave it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said the attendant, “they do not teach the child
such things, and they do not approve of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who does not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father and a cousin—they are good people, but
are unbelievers in all such matters; and though they seldom
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>
dispute with others, they never admit of any instruction
to their child about religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said I, “she must know something about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, sir; she does not know what you mean by
a spirit or a soul. How should she know—the cousin is
her teacher, and she never refers to the subject, and forbids
it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the child has been taught something of the kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who taught her, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps God. But I will see whether she has any
idea of the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, my child, what the soul is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sir—do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not like to reply to her query—so I proceeded,
“Your mother has yet an existence, and if she was good—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my mother was very good—always good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the spirit which animated her body is in the
enjoyment of all the good belonging to its present state,
which the body could enjoy on earth—it is happy.” I was
ashamed of the explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it be like her, if I could see it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably exactly like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And could I see or know of her real existence in that
state?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, though not usual. All is possible with God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I understand you. I have seen her often—often
at night; and I have started as if I had been asleep. But
at night I see my mother just as she looked when I saw
her before her death, only there seemed to be light around
her head, and she moved easily and rapidly. Oh, how
night after night I have been with her, toiling on to overtake
her steps, or carried rapidly forward; sometimes she
seems to give me instruction—sometimes I rise in the
morning and think I will pray to her, or I will pray
God to give her to me again; and I have made known my
feelings to cousin, and she has laughed at me or chid me
for being so babyish as to be thoughtful about dreams.
But I see now that this was truly my mother, and I will
watch to-night, and when she comes again, I will ask her
about her soul—have we all souls?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think, <span class='it'>now</span>, that I could have placed the child in
a position to comprehend these things a little better; but
<span class='it'>then</span> I was confused with the extraordinary state of the
child’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did God teach her that?” said the attendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he not teach her that?” I turned away as I saw
some one coming down the walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did God teach that child? Was it the yet unfaded
visions from which her soul was drawn, ere it became a
tenant of the clayey tabernacle that was overshadowing
her mind; the recollections of heaven illuminating its little
earthly experience, growing dimmer and dimmer with
time—was that the mother in the child, or was there, indeed,
an appeal to its mind through its affections?
Had she, shut out from all instructors during the day,
denied all the knowledge which is the true foundation of
a Christian’s life—denied it by father and relative—had she,
in her bed, been met as little Samuel was met, by the voice
of God, calling up the mind to its high destiny, and instructing
it in the things that were to come?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not solve this enigma. But how innocent, how
attractive to the spirit of goodness must have been the
mind of that little girl; and it would not be strange, at
least it would seem most meet, that her guardian spirit
should find means to awaken in her a sense of her importance,
and to invite her to goodness by her love for a
departed mother. I turned round before I left the ground,
and saw the little child standing beside the grave. She
looked down steadily upon the uplifted earth, and then
turned her face upward, and seemed to gaze with intense
interest into the blue sky above. I would have given
much to know the thoughts that had occupied her mind, to
have seen how love for the perishing object below, how
reverence for the purified spirit above were alternating in
her mind. I am sure that her thoughts had in them more
of maturity and truth relative to those objects of her contemplation,
than they had of the things of this life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I passed onward to the road, full of the idea of the child,
who could not be deprived of knowledge. I had found an
early flower—the chill of winter, its snows and its frosts,
had forbidden its development—but a gentle ray from the
sun of truth had called it forth; it was blossoming for
man, delightful now, to be transplanted to its native
heaven hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Sewing Girl.</span>—The inequality of social life and
domestic comfort in large cities, is, we presume, inseparable
from a state of society as at present organized, and
the bold reformer, even while he is preaching, is illustrating
its incapacity for sudden change. So long as capital
possesses supreme power, and the inherent quality of reproduction,
there must be dependents and laborers. We
cannot all ride in carriages, or there would be none to
build them, and the present stock, we think, would in time
grow ricketty upon the hands of the most adroit leveler.
And if we descended into a race of pedestrians, we fear
that we should in time, even if we divided the last dollar
with a needy brother, be looked upon as soulless and decidedly
shabby. We do not know that Fourier, even in
his maddest dreams of social reformation and equality,
ever seriously contemplated an era when boots should
grow upon trees, without the aid of human hands, and
coats come down like snow-flakes to cover our nakedness.
We think not. And even if he had, there are certain disagreeable
anticipations—aside from want of modesty—in
wandering about on a wintry day, hunting for garments—to
say nothing of having our beef killed and cooked to
stay our appetites the while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We suppose then we must have sewing girls—but we
see no necessity of forgetting that they are girls—and
neither horses nor mules—that they are human beings—noble
women, with as warm hearts, and as good blood as
ourselves, feeling the same yearnings after sympathy, the
same keenness of suffering under insult, neglect or wrong.
There is no necessary humiliation in labor. It is in itself
of the highest dignity and of the loftiest nobility of extraction.
She who, by assiduous industry, makes her
little home happy, clothes her infant brothers, and administers
to the wants of an aged and decrepit parent, has
clothed herself in the holiest of garments, and though
their texture may not be of the finest, she may stand up
proudly beside the purple of a queen, and if she sees but
the trembling of scorn upon the royal lip, may say,
“<span class='it'>Stand off! I am nobler than thou!</span>” The treatment,
however, which some of them receive from very fashionable
and very silly young ladies, who have been badly
educated by ignorant and vulgar mothers, is humiliating
to witness occasionally, and must be very hard to bear
continually.</p>

And yet the fashionable young lady may number among
her accomplishments a smattering of French, or a villainous
enunciation of Italian; may thrash the piano,
with all discordancy, and nurse her poodle dog with infinite
grace, and call it very fatiguing, and be obliged to
take a nap after dinner, for fear her strength may fail her
in the evening, in the waltz with Mr. Alfred Fitzhuggens,
who labors under the accomplishments of an imperial and
a dandy cane; while the young sewing girl may be devoting
diligently sixteen hours out of the weary twenty-four,
in earning the most indifferent food for a family of
dependents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We wonder if these young ladies while thumbing their
gilt prayer-books on Sunday, and lisping over the prayer,
“From all blindness of heart, from pride, vain glory, and
hypocrisy; from envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitableness,
<span class='it'>Good Lord, deliver us</span>,” ever think of the
meaning and solemn import of the words they are using.
We doubt it. Or in the more direct adjuration, “That
it may please thee to strengthen those who stand, <span class='it'>and
comfort and help the weak hearted</span>,” they ever think how
little their heartlessness to dependents justifies them in
putting up the prayer. Or still further, do they ever think
of the obligations of that sublime command, in which
Christianity sparkles like a divine light, “As ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” We
fear that at many a table where grace is said, the hearts
who hear it are utterly graceless in this regard, and that
many who are very rigid in paying the formalities of
prayer to God, forget the divine injunction, “feed my
lambs,” and would rather add an additional hour to the
day of toil, and a shilling less to the pay of the toil-worn
sewing girl, than to lighten her burdens by a cheerful
word or token of encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not that we wish for a moment to be supposed as intimating
that this lack of enlarged charity is wanting in
well trained hypocrites only—who do not dishonor religion,
but by daily acts prove its truth and beauty, by showing
that they are none of Christ’s. The haughty assumption
and vulgar domineering is far worse where <span class='it'>all</span> restraint
is thrown off, and worldliness unmitigated and shameless,
in scarlet and effrontery, rides purse proud over the decencies
as well as the charities of life, and makes dependency
a worse slavery than that of the poor Indian in the mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of a lady is in no way more surely tested
than in treatment of her domestics—and, <span class='it'>generally</span>, in the
frequency with which she changes them. Depend upon
it—the house in which <span class='it'>nobody</span> can be happy, must be a
miniature of existence in a darker world.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Cape May Season.</span>—As the warm weather steals upon
us, our friends begin to talk of “the Capes,” and to look
up straw hats and bathing-dresses. Cape May has in its
very sound a charm pleasingly familiar to almost every
Philadelphia ear. Here visits the merchant in the summer
months, for relaxation from the counting-room—the clerk
for his holydays—the man of pleasure for enjoyment—the
idle for luxurious indolence. It is Philadelphia in miniature,
and full of life—lively, chatty, gossipy, and hilarious—disposed
to enjoyment, and determined to have it. A
family reunion at holyday times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman has a reputation abroad for great
simplicity of manner—wearing his coat of the very purest
material, and of the very plainest cut—and a hat of undeniable
beaver, of great amplitude of brim; a sturdy old
chap, with a benevolent face, who gives his simple and
emphatic “No!” to the allurements and pressing solicitations
of folly. The younger shoots have departed greatly
from the plainness of the primitive tree, and flourish in the
luxuriousness of magnolia and orange blossoms, and show
a strong tendency to burst out in all the beauty and
splendor of hot-house “japonicadom.” Yet under the
eye of the old gentleman, in these holyday times, the
youngsters seem to scorn the borrowed aid of laces, satins
and jewelry, and give tight boots, dandy-coats, and perfumery
the go-by; for it is whispered, that he shuts his
money-box rather tightly to such of his heirs as run after
worldly vanities; so that here you may see them in
blouses and straw-hats, in dressing-gown and slippers,
perfectly unrestrained with tight lacing, luxuriously
happy, and indescribably gay. They go about with an
honest, hearty, unrestrained laugh—snapping their fingers
at care, and perfectly unconcerned at the imputation of
having let down their dignity. The family improves evidently
under this relaxation from brocades and stiff ceremonies.
They have a more hearty expression of face, a
more thoroughly robust and vigorous frame, and though
the cheek may be a little browner, the eye is brighter, and
the heart happier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regular visiter at these times is a black-eyed, cherry-cheeked
cousin from Baltimore, a little given to flirting
and dangerously fascinating, as graceful as a young fawn,
and as frolicksome as a kitten. She always appears to
have come down purposely for a romp, having left city
affectations at home, and brought her graces with her.
Then she wont go home until she has half a dozen of her
cousins—from the third to the sixth remove—desperately
in love with her, to keep them in mind of Cape May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then “Tom”—“Our Tom”—he is always there; Tom
wouldn’t miss Cape May, in the season, for a £100—and
the sly dog knows how to show off the attractions of his
beautiful cousins. He is sure to decoy them into the
Archery every bright morning, and has so many neat and
appropriate remarks in regard to the health and gracefulness
of the exercise—and the bows are so inviting, and the
arrows so neat—the gold and crimson target so tempting
that you do not wonder to see a cloud of arrows filling
the air, and a crowd of lounging <span class='it'>beaux</span>, filled with shafts
more dangerous. Then “Tom”—sad Tom—knows that
his fair cousins are as fearless as beautiful, and fire off
pistols with quite a soldierly air—that is, when Tom loads
them; and the sly scamp, speaks in so low a tone—so softly
and so kindly—when he hands the pistol with the hair-trigger,
that you are amazed to find that there was powder
in it when it goes off—and at the first crack “Tom” has
the whole family there; then he is such a lover of enjoyment
himself—is good, honest, manly Tom Barrett—that
it delights him to see them. Then he has his Bowling
Saloons in tiptop order; his Billiard-room, too; his dogs
and guns for crack shots at woodcock, and ambitious young
sportsmen after curlew; and then he has—In short, it
wouldn’t <span class='it'>be</span> Cape May, if Tom wasn’t there—and there’s
an end of it. Well, well, Tom! we shall not try your
pistols nor your archery this summer, but shall take a
crack at Cape May, in a story, which we have in type.
So let the surf come tumbling in with its musical roar—its
wild waves wash out no memories. Our loves and our
hates keep time in the heart which beats on proudly, yet
bides its time hopefully. In the roar of the wilder ocean,
where men go down battling unregretted, how many who
now spread their bright sails to the favoring breeze, shall,
ere the voyage is ended, find sail and cordage gone, their
vessels wrecked, and the happy hearts of merry companions,
one after the other, swept by the remorseless wave forever
under—who shall tell, Tom! But so the side toward
heaven has been ripened by the sunlight of kindness to man,
what matters the breakers, Tom, to you or to me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sad effects of an insane haste to grow rich by
chasing gilded shadows, instead of taking the secure path
of industry, are exemplified in the fact, that hundreds
of our countrymen who have abandoned places of profit
for the dazzling placers of speculation, and business, which
afforded a decent competency, for wild and uncertain adventure,
are now crowding the shore of the Pacific at
Panama, with exhausted means and dissipated hopes. The
all-absorbing desire for speedy fortune precluded even
the common and most ordinary caution as to probabilities.
At the first sound of the horn, the hunter was off, regardless
of obstacles, defiant of fate, and with a recklessness
unpardonable, the comforts of home were sacrificed, and
all the dangers of a doubtful, hardy, and perilous enterprise
were imprudently braved. The sad uncertainty of
fortune—the more than doubts of her existence for them—has
been cruelly thrust into their faces, and impressed upon
their hearts. The return of that tremendous tide, which
seemed to sweep wise men and madmen together resistlessly
upon its bosom, comes freighted with the first fragments
of hopes wrecked, and wealth, and perhaps health
dissipated and lost. Time and opportunity here—more
valuable than gold—are gone, and the adventurer comes
back with unstrung nerves and faded visions of greatness,
to battle again in the busy and uncompromising marts of
trade, for bread. The illusion has vanished!—the cheat
is transparent! “The sober second-thought” has come
with its impressive lesson. The blanks turn out in this, as
in all lotteries, the most numerous and certain—the prizes
equally few and unreliable. When the voice of that vaster
multitude now filling the streams and plains of California
shall have been heard, we shall have a sonorous echo of
the despairing wail of the impoverished and deluded at
Panama. Mark it!</p>

<hr class='tbk148'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Be sure you are right, and then go ahead” is a maxim
so universally current in this country, that one would
suppose that its practice would be more common. But
no! in the rush of excitement, the go-ahead spirit takes
the lead, leaving at home old father Caution to play with
his thumbs, and to wonder at his relations. “Get out of
the way!” “Take care!” “Clear the track!” “Off she
goes!”—<span class='it'>whiz!</span> and the young generation is cut from
leading-strings, and half-way on the road to fortune before
Grandfather has rubbed his eyes, and opened them to the
true state of affairs around him—no, not <span class='it'>around</span>, before
him, but completely out of sight. Talk of Rome not
having been built in a day, old Graybeard! You are behind
the times. Kingdoms shoot up in a night, and nations
are born between two breakfasts. Don’t speak of the
ingratitude of relations, old man; the thing is absurd.
While you are hunting genealogies, the parties have belted
the world, and are walking with their heads down directly
beneath you, or are half-way to the Pacific on an air-line
in the light that marks the horizon—skimming through
the clouds in a flying machine. “Friendly ties.” “Home
affection!” Poh! you are in your dotage, old fellow!
We have no time to waste on silly abstractions! Good
bye! Take care of <span class='it'>yourself</span>! Will write you from the
other side! So we go!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But are we happier for all this fiery impetuosity of disposition—this
ginger-beer effervescence of intellect—this
fussing, fretting, fuming wrath of haste to get on, to get off,
to be going? Is <span class='it'>this</span> the true enjoyment of <span class='sc'>LIFE</span>! after all,
to go whirling along in a state of high excitement without
a moment’s pause, with a sort of insane heat and fierceness
of intellect, restless, roaming, and parched up with
the fever of desire for wealth—to be enslaved by the
eternal, all-absorbing all-engulphing <span class='it'>I</span>—the monster self,
grown Colossal, insatiate, and fiend-like. Is there nothing
worth loving, that we may pause to cherish? No
enjoyment worth a cool moment, in which the fevered
lust of money may be forgotten? Pile up your gold,
young man! Give your imagination its most boundless
desire! Spread the base of your pyramid over an area of
acres! Pile up!—pile high! oh, avarice and pride! Let
its peak touch the skies! ay, higher still! And now we
point you to that little cluster of bleached bones, whitening
but a spot beside the gigantic god you worship, and
to that young, pale face, sitting sighing by yonder fire-side,
thousands of miles away—would the wealth that
might cover the Cyclops, compensate <span class='it'>her</span> for the chilled
heart, the desolate days which are hers. Ah no! with
but a crust to break with you, in a home of humbleness
and peace, how that heart would bound with pride, those
sad eyes sparkle with pleasure, and those pale cheeks
regain their roses and bloom with health. And if all the
wealth of India and Peru were hers, how poor a gift would
she esteem it to clothe those bones of yours once again
with manly beauty, and to sit once again confidingly by
your side, her hand in yours, her eyes lifted to your dark
gaze, as to the heaven of her dreams. Ah! but you will
not die, you will take the risk. Pause awhile! think
of it wisely! think of it well!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are not talking in the language of statesmen. Ah,
no! statesmen and warriors estimate men in masses—marshal
them in squadrons and platoons; they form a
State—they fill a list of 10,000 killed and wounded. Ours
is the humbler view—the domestic ties lacerated—the
friendships dissipated—the few hearts broken. The dead
of the ten thousand slain upon the battle-field return no
more—the thrice ten thousand hearts that mourn, bleed
on, but form no part of the estimate of war’s disaster.
The thousands of brothers, young, impetuous, adventurous,
are gone! they are the State’s, and of it. The
sister weeps—the mother droops and dies, as the long years
roll on, and the lost ones return no more; and the proud
page of history swells with the triumph, the pen grows
eloquent as it records the foundation and the growth of
empire, and bright names live and flash along the glowing
line; but the desolate heart, and the desolate hearth,
are forgotten and unknown. These are the sadder views
of conquest—the inevitable results of adventurous migration.
“And yet,” cries the brawling patriot who is
never <span class='it'>self</span> devoted, “you oppose the march of empire—the
growth of nations!” By no means, good friend! If
the thousands who are now pouring as a flood into California,
or even a tythe of them, were whole families, with
farming utensils, and domestic implements, seeking a far
off and productive soil, where they might again erect their
household gods, and live happily to a green old age, under
their own vine and fig-tree, extending rationally and naturally
the benefits of civilization, we should wish them
God speed, and give them joy at their going. But how
is it? Reader, we ask <span class='it'>you</span>—how is it with the adventurers,
who are now rushing thoughtlessly, desperately
from home? How few, even with the best success, will
realize their dreams? and of those few, how many will
really be personally benefited by the wealth thus achieved?
But the vast army of the disappointed—what of them?
With morals contaminated, hearts sickened, hopes crushed—how
many will return useful members of society? How
many settle quietly down as hardy tillers of the soil? We
fear, oh, most wise politician! that this last is a work to
be done by another class of emigrants, and by but few
of the gold hunters, and desperate land speculators who
now crowd the vessels of the Pacific. Our advice, deeply
pondered, and calmly given, to those who have a longing
for that far-off and fertile region, is, to sit earnestly down
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
to business here, and amass a few hundreds, or a few
thousands, and when the scorn of that boiling, seething
cauldron shall have passed off—when the thousands which
have been made—<span class='it'>on paper</span>—in land speculations and gold
mining, shall be no more heard of—you will find a few
quiet acres still untilled, a population improved, and a
certainty of comfort and happiness awaiting you there.
Until then, we think, you may make life bearable here, by
diligent application to business, a devotion to your family,
to home duties and affections, and to careful improvement
of your mental capacity, and of such opportunities as God
may furnish you for doing good. Think of it, reader!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Family Messenger.</span>—This old and sterling
family newspaper, we see, has been brought out in a suit
of new and beautiful type, and is otherwise improved and
adorned. It has had, too, an accession of editorial force,
and the new pen, with the aid of Mr. Seckel, its old editor,
makes the sheet sparkle again. We predict for the old
favorite a new lease of popular favor, and a circulation
unequaled by any paper of its class. Various other additions,
in the mechanical as well as the literary department,
are still to be added, when the office is removed to
the new building in Chestnut street—the movements of
beauty on that delightful promenade, will, of course, be
duly chronicled hereafter, in the piquant style of the

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A Powerful Novel.</span>—We shall commence in the
July number, a powerfully written story from the pen
of H. W. Herbert, Esq., author of “Cromwell,” “Ringwood
the Rover,” etc., which we pronounce the most
brilliant of all the able novels of that accomplished and
vigorous writer. It is entitled “<span class='sc'>Jasper St. <a id='aubyn'></a>Aubyn</span>; <span class='it'>A
Story of Passion</span>,” and for strength and beauty of expression,
thrilling and intense interest, and high moral and

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Birds Beautifully Colored.</span>—We purpose to introduce
into Graham’s Magazine, in the coming volume, a
series of Wild and Cage Birds, exquisitely designed and
colored, and our artists are already at work. We think
that this feature of the Magazine will be highly popular
with our readers, and as the plates will be accompanied
with carefully prepared letter-press descriptions; they
will be found useful to the many who cultivate a taste
for these beautiful subjects. This, we have no doubt, will
be <span class='it'>imitated</span> as every thing has been in the Magazine world
which has originated with us.</p>

<hr class='tbk152'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Oldest Magazine.</span>—Our correspondent, “History,”
is informed that he is right in his conjecture, that
“Graham’s Magazine” was based upon “<span class='it'>The Casket</span>,”
and hence is the oldest of the illustrated monthlies. It
is our proud satisfaction that ours is the <span class='it'>best</span>, as well as
the oldest Magazine. It does not require continued puffing,
either hired or solicited, to make people aware of its
existence.</p>

<hr class='tbk153'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Our Own Artists Abroad.</span>—In order to keep the
high position of this Magazine, as a work of art, fully up
to the standard it has attained, we have sent our excellent
engraver and designer, W. E. Tucker, Esq., to Europe to
make careful drawings of such subjects as he may find
upon the walls of the Academies, or in private collections,
and to engage such American artists as he may find abroad,
who may be useful in carrying out our grand design of
being <span class='it'>the first to introduce new subjects to the American eye</span>.
Our cotemporaries content themselves with re-engraving
stale prints which may be found in the windows, or in
using such cast-off English plates as may be offered here
cheap; but the vast circulation and profit of this work returns
to our readers in such liberal arrangements to keep
them advised of the freshest and most beautiful works of
art as may be found in the wide range of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several years our Fashion Plates have been brought
freshly from Paris, and their beauty of design and coloring
has been the subject of universal praise. Now, by having
<span class='it'>our own artists</span> employed, both abroad and at home, we not
only defy competition, but laugh at it.</p>

<hr class='tbk154'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The New Volume.</span>—With the next number we commence
a new volume of Graham’s Magazine, which, we
do not hesitate to promise our readers shall be one of rare
excellence and beauty. Our past volume, closing with
this number, was exhausted very early, and we have consequently
been obliged for two months past to refuse all
orders for the work from January last. We shall therefore
furnish our subscribers with a title page for the coming
volume in our next issue. All our arrangements for
the next six months are perfected, and from July to December
our readers may expect a succession of brilliant
numbers in every respect. Our increase for the past six
months has been unexampled, and with the steady flow of
new names, coming with every mail, we look forward to
being compelled greatly to amplify our means of producing
our edition. Our printers now run their presses both
night and day—keeping us frequently waiting for copies
to supply the demand. Hoe certainly must invent a <span class='it'>book-press</span>
to run 10,000 per hour for us, and at our demise we
shall leave him the copyright of Graham.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Rivals.</span>—We see a great deal about the rivals of Graham,
going the rounds in the way of paid notices. Does
the oldest inhabitant remember a time when such notes
were not given out? We have a brood of these rivals,
freshly fledged every spring, who die somehow of the
praise of the penny-a-liners in literature,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snooks has an article in the “Great Monthly Thundergust,”
calculated to make a noise.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
